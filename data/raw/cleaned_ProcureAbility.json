    "text": "Sustainability in Procurement Sustainability in Procurement Redefining supply chain efficiency in a new era For most CEOs, sustainability in procurement and supply chain management is now an essential part of the long-term corporate agenda. Beyond integrating ESG goals into corporate strategy, many companies have made public commitments (such as achieving net-zero emissions by 2025 or 2030) while recognizing that regulations and global supply chains are constantly evolving especially considering the changing political landscapes across the world. Regardless of who sets the strategy or makes the pledge, it often falls to procurement and supply chain teams to deliver on those promises against the organizational ESG Goals. These teams are tasked with synthesizing expanding public-facing sustainability goals and translating them into actionable plans, with clear metrics, timelines, and accountability. Whether it s navigating new regulations, tracking managing global emissions, ensuring ethical labor practices, or evaluating the performance of n-tier suppliers against this sustainability goals, procurement must demonstrate measurable impact and be ready to communicate it clearly. Enhancing supply chain transparency through multi-tier sustainability reporting One of the biggest challenges in sustainable procurement is over-reliance on self-reported supplier data. While self-reporting is a useful starting point, it s often not sufficient to serve as evidence that companies are living up to their commitments, especially when you move beyond tier-1 suppliers. Can a CEO or CPO confidently say that sustainability data from tier-2 or tier-3 suppliers is accurate? Often, the answer is no. The solution lies in implementing robust supplier audit processes and digital tools for verification, ensuring that all claims are traceable and verifiable. Most procurement organizations have a detailed understanding of their tier-1 suppliers, but the further down the supply chain you go, the harder it is to monitor. Achieving reliable multi-tier supplier transparency requires close collaboration with direct suppliers encouraging them to adopt the same level of scrutiny and accountability with their own suppliers. It s important to have strong data and process governance along with the tools to maximize the efficacy of the data that is collected. Embedding circular supply chain practices into procurement strategy Beyond traditional n-tier supply chain models, today s companies must embed circular economy principles into product design and procurement processes. This is particularly critical in eCommerce and consumer goods sectors, where packaging, delivery, and returns introduce major sustainability challenges. Reverse logistics, packaging waste, and short product lifecycles (especially in fashion and electronics) demand a shift from linear to circular thinking. That means sourcing materials designed for reuse, planning for end-of-life product collection, and embedding circularity into every stage of procurement not just during annual reviews or Earth Day campaigns. Building a sustainable global supply chain workforce Sustainable procurement isn t just about materials and emissions, it s also about human capital. As companies expand into global markets like India, Vietnam, Mexico, or China, there s enormous potential to build thriving, ethical labor forces. But simply hiring talent for short-term gain is not sustainable in the long run. Organizations need to invest in the right organization building capabilities to enable this thriving new supply chain workforce. True supply chain sustainability involves investing in local communities, supporting skills development, and building a workforce capable of adapting to evolving manufacturing and service needs. Even in the U.S., the talent gap is a major consideration and potentially a barrier to reshoring manufacturing at scale. Procurement must take an active role in shaping the workforce of the future by collaborating with HR, local governments, and NGOs to drive sustainable economic development. This might also need a concerted effort in supplier development programs to meet long-term objectives. Aligning procurement strategy with ESG accountability and public expectations Procurement s role in sustainability doesn t end with internal implementation. Increasingly, sustainability progress is shared publicly, in ESG reports, investor briefings, and press releases. That means procurement teams must prepare for scrutiny and be ready to stand behind their strategies and results. Today s consumers and markets expect transparency and accountability across even the most complex global supply chains. Whether or not procurement teams are accustomed to public-facing roles, they must be ready to respond equipped with data, context, and credibility. This readiness starts with sustainable planning processes: How will performance be defined, measured, and enforced? How can procurement create an extended value chain that s not only efficient but also resilient and responsible? Procurement as a strategic driver of sustainable change As procurement and supply chain teams work to meet (and exceed) sustainability goals, they must navigate a rapidly shifting landscape with clarity, intent, and resilience. By strengthening supplier transparency across all tiers, embedding circular economy principles, prioritizing ethical and future-ready labor forces, and aligning with corporate ESG accountability, Procurement can lead the transformation towards a truly sustainable supply chain. It s not just a support function anymore it s a strategic lever for long-term business success.

    "text": "Procurement Transformation: Moving Your Procurement Organization from Tactical to Strategic As the global marketplace continues to evolve, the procurement industry is forced to adapt at a rapid pace. Procurement leaders must be vigilant in keeping up with the latest trends and best practices, not only to stay ahead of the curve but also to maintain their competitive edge. Procurement continues to go through a transformative evolution as it delivers greater value for the organization and earns a strategic seat at the table. A Procurement Strategic Roadmap is an essential starting point to outline an effective approach and guide the efforts of a department s process improvement efforts while remaining relevant and providing value to the stakeholders to whom it serves. In this critical effort, they are finding that a procurement transformation sets them up for success. Such projects redefine and optimize procurement processes to drive greater value and efficiency, while also contributing to topline growth. When done correctly, a procurement transformation improves the effectiveness of procurement operations by switching the mindset of procurement leaders and stakeholders from tactical to strategic. Measurable Results One of the key benefits of a procurement transformation is the cost savings that come from implementing best practices to help organizations negotiate better contracts, optimize spend management and reduce supply chain risk. Another benefit is increased efficiency: through streamlining processes and automating manual tasks with innovative technology, organizations can improve data accuracy and reduce errors across their supply chain. Undergoing a procurement transformation can also help organizations stay competitive by improving their agility and enabling them to adapt to changing marketing conditions. The most successful transformations leverage data analytics and technology solutions such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, source-to-pay and spend analytics tools and supplier data to gain deeper insights into their supply chain, while also establishing up-to-date benchmarks and KPIs that help them to make informed decisions. Although the benefits of a procurement transformation are invaluable, the process can be a complex and challenging undertaking. Most organizations don t even know where to begin. Whether the objective is to optimize cost savings or enhance supplier relationships, procurement leaders must ensure they are taking the necessary steps to safeguard both their current and future state. But order is everything, and initiatives taken out of turn can diminish the transformation s effectiveness. By partnering with outside resources, procurement leaders can benefit from receiving a strategic road map focused on identifying key areas of opportunity, prioritizing investments to be made, and equipping leaders with the resources they need to navigate the various challenges that might arise during the process. Elements for Success Although there is no one-size-fits-all approach to undergoing a successful transformation, key elements often include: Organizational Design During a procurement transformation, it is essential that the right organizational structure, stakeholder roles, processes and even culture support the strategic objectives and goals of the transformation. Process improvement One key aspect of a procurement transformation is that the procurement process is reengineered to focus on optimizing category management, strategic procurement, and supplier management. Technology Implementation To successfully improve processes, a procurement transformation plan will need to leverage technology to streamline and automate key procurement activities including supplier identification, contract management and spend analysis. Change Management Stakeholders impacted by the procurement transformation need to be ready and willing to implement changes. Effective change management can be achieved through timely communication, training, and adoption strategies. KPIs and Benchmarking To understand the effectiveness and ROI of a transformation, the plan includes most key processes for monitoring and evaluating progress from start to finish. This includes tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) such as on-time delivery, maverick spend reduction, supplier diversity metrics, and inventory turnover.

    "text": "PROCUREMENT 101 A step-by-step guide to the procurement process Listen to this article 10 min Effective procurement is a vital function within any business, capable of making substantial contributions to an organization s efficiency and financial prosperity when executed proficiently. Despite its widespread impact, the process of procurement is often underappreciated in the hustle and bustle of everyday operations. Successful procurement operations may appear to be effortless, but for the individuals and expert teams that navigate its complexities, procurement is understood to require both method and discipline. In this step-by-step guide, we ll take a closer look at the stages of the procurement process and how targeted improvements can close critical gaps, boosting overall efficiency and output, and thus strengthening the bottom line. While there is a general outline for the procurement process, it s important to keep in mind that the specifics are shaped by the needs and goals of each individual organization. Factors that will affect the procurement process stages include the size and location of the organization, the prevailing business model, the company structure, and budgetary and spending needs, among others. We ll cover the seven foundational stages that are typically employed in the procurement process. Identify the need Create and submit a purchase request Evaluate and select suppliers vendors Negotiate the terms Finalize the contract Implement the сontract Manage the supplier Identify the need Procurement is driven by need, whether it s producing a final product or service or acquiring the underlying products or services that aid in their creation. Depending on the company structure, this step might be managed by the business owners, department heads, executive team, staff, and or procurement managers. During this initial procurement phase, these parties work to set a budget against the backdrop of the organization s overall spending plans. Stakeholders and procurement teams play crucial roles in defining purchasing needs within an organization. Effective collaboration between these groups ensures that the right products, services, and resources are acquired to meet business objectives. Procurement teams partner closely with stakeholders to gather detailed requirements. This involves understanding the technical specifications, quality standards, quantity needed, delivery timelines, and any other critical parameters necessary to ensure success for each procurement phase. Stakeholders provide this information based on their expertise and understanding of the project or operational requirements. Create and submit a purchase request A purchase request (or purchase requisition) is a formal request for goods or services and is submitted using specialized procurement software. Oftentimes, the purchase request will originate with an employee or manager before being reviewed by the organization s procurement team. When a purchase request is approved, it becomes a purchase order. However, should the request be denied, it will typically be returned to the submitter with a brief explanation. A rejected purchase order, while not ideal, can be a good learning opportunity. When a purchase order is rejected, it often indicates that something went wrong in the procurement process. It could be a mistake in the specifications, pricing, quantities, or other details. By analyzing the reasons for rejection, the organization can identify the specific areas where mistakes were made and implement corrective measures. This helps prevent similar errors in future purchase orders. If the rejection was due to supplier-related issues, it offers an opportunity to engage with the supplier to discuss the problem and potential solutions. This interaction can lead to better communication, understanding, and collaboration between the organization and its suppliers. Strengthening supplier relationships can help to ensure that teams reach their procurement goals and improve future procurement outcomes. Evaluate and select suppliers vendors The next step is to assess various vendors who can fulfill the purchase order and choose one that meets the key requirements necessary to reach procurement goals. Notably, price shouldn t be the sole determinant. Other factors that should be considered include ease of communication, company ethics, accountability, and production capacities. Added up, these factors provide a big picture procurement teams can use to evaluate vendors. Some organizations maintain a catalog of approved vendors, featuring various suppliers that have already proven themselves. Others may need to start from scratch, particularly when the purchase order supports a new line of business or geography. Supplier selection is a component of the procurement process steps that can range from standard to complex, with the exact approach determined by the requirement(s) at hand. Strategic Sourcing should be used for complex, custom, and long-term requirements; tactical buying is typically used with standard or simple short-term requirements. These two distinct approaches within the procurement process are each suited for different scenarios based on the nature of the purchase, its strategic importance, and the overall goals of the organization. Below are two examples of situations where sourcing and tactical buying are appropriate: Strategic Sourcing If a manufacturing company requires a consistent and reliable supply of raw materials for its production processes, sourcing is essential. Establishing strategic partnerships with suppliers helps secure the necessary materials, negotiate favorable terms, and maintain quality standards. Tactical Buying When equipment breaks down unexpectedly, the organization might need to quickly procure replacement parts or services. Tactical buying ensures swift resolution of issues. After a vendor has been selected, investing time and energy in the relationship is critical. A good relationship with a supplier can unlock better savings and service, delivering maximum value in the long term. Negotiate the terms Once you have chosen the best fit, it s time to move on to contract negotiations. This is one of the most critical stages in successful procurement, as it serves as the legal framework for everything that follows. During this stage, you will outline and agree to pricing as well as details such as delivery schedules, recourse for missed orders or delays, and other specific terms and conditions. It is often useful to assess previous contracts to pinpoint opportunities for improvement, allowing you to potentially secure better terms going forward and address inadequacies in prior contracts. Finalize the contract A contract can be finalized with a Purchase Order (PO), Master Service Agreement (MSA), or Statement of Work (SOW). A PO is used to order goods or services, an MSA establishes the overarching legal and operational framework for a business relationship, and an SOW defines the specific work to be done in a project or service engagement. These documents are often used together, with the MSA setting the general terms, the SOW specifying the project-specific details, and the PO defining the specific order details. After the contract has been approved, the next stage is to finalize the PO. The contract typically governs the full buyer supplier relationship, while a PO specifies the terms of an individual purchase. This PO document can be considered as another formal contract, which details the following: Total costs price Detailed description of goods and or services Quantity Order date Delivery date Buyer s contact information Supplier s contact information Billing address Shipping address Payment method Payment due date Payment currency Shipping method Warranty information Name and title of the person who approved the purchase Date of authorization Any other specific terms and conditions With a final PO, you are ready to move to the final stage of the procurement process. Implement the сontract Successfully implementing a new contract requires a structured approach and a series of actions to ensure that the new supplier or new relationship with an incumbent supplier can be seamlessly integrated into your organization s operations. Here are the key actions needed to achieve a successful implementation: Communicate with business stakeholders about the new supplier agreement s conditions and its impact on current processes. For new suppliers, host welcome meetings to introduce them to your organization and address any concerns or expectations. Provide necessary training on your company s systems, products, services, and quality and safety standards. Conduct technology integration with your procurement or inventory management systems, including providing access to collaboration and communication tools. By following these steps, you can ensure smooth and successful contract implementation. Effective vendor communication is crucial for managing orders in the procurement process and forming long-term relationships. As goods or services are delivered, it is important for the purchasing side, especially the end-user, to confirm that all contract and purchase order standards have been met. This includes verifying delivery deadlines, product quantities, and product quality. In the event of any issues, such as damaged products, clear communication with the vendor becomes essential. Promptly addressing delivery problems and maintaining open lines of communication helps to build a strong and long-term relationship with the vendor. By effectively managing vendor communication, the procurement process can be streamlined, and orders can be successfully fulfilled. Manage the supplier Effective supplier management involves focusing on supplier performance, partnering to enhance value, and ensuring contract compliance. It is essential to establish clear performance expectations with defined KPIs and SLAs for mutual success. Ongoing supplier relationship management includes regular reviews, feedback sessions, and performance monitoring to drive quality, service, and cost improvements. Optimize your supplier management for success through maintaining open communications and clear escalation procedures, implementing quality control processes and tailored performance reports, and applying well-defined criteria for contract renewal or termination based on performance and evolving business needs. https: procureability.com what-are-the-stages-of-procurement-process",

    "text": "Navigating the Top Five Procurement Pitfalls: An Industry Expert s Inside Guide Every organization makes mistakes, but when mistakes happen in procurement they tend to snowball. Due to the involved nature of the procurement function, any mistake along the timeline can lead to myriad others down the line, negatively impacting company performance. The good news is, better communication solves issues between staff, management, suppliers, and partner companies. By understanding the most common mistakes procurement professionals make, you can learn to prevent them. Here are five areas where things can go wrong, along with tips for how to avoid these common challenges. Accepting prices without negotiation A common procurement mistake is assuming that the catalogue price is set in stone. Depending on the scale of your organization and your relationship with suppliers, prices, lead times, freight charges and, in some cases, consignment arrangements are often open for negotiation. To help pave the way for such opportunities, keep the lines of communication open with your suppliers and look for solutions that create a win-win for both parties. Early renewals are a great place to start. By sharing your future forecasts with your suppliers, they will feel more secure about the steadiness of your business. It might be enough for them to bend on price or agree to other concessions. Choosing lower quality for lower costs One of the biggest challenges in procurement is making sure you choose dependable suppliers who match your standards for quality, ethics, and values. All too often, procurement teams compromise on these principals for a good deal, only to receive sub-par products that don t match the original agreement, arrive late, aren t produced ethically, or fall short for some other reason. To avoid such lapses, work to improve your supplier selection process. Learn more about your suppliers and their processes. Conduct regular visits and audits to ensure they are capable enough to meet your quality standards and deliver products and services on time. Formulate better-worded questionnaires during the supplier selection process to help ensure a good fit. A rigorous focus on quality will ensure that procurement remains a valued partner to your internal business partners. Losing spending control and visibility Organizations go beyond their budgets for a wide variety of reasons, including poor management and unexpected inflation. Once the budget is created, it should be reviewed in as much detail as possible. Track your spending in real time and right the ship quickly in cases where you overspend. This heightened level of transparency will facilitate data-driven discussions with the finance department when creating budgets or requesting additional funds due to unexpected costs. Making snap decisions At times, purchasing professionals may procure goods or services without considering the strategic alignment to business requirements. This often means ignoring the normal procurement process, which is a common issue among organizations experiencing rapid growth. Consider deploying purchase order software such as Coupa or Ariba SAP to keep track of old orders and to formalise procurement steps such as creating purchase orders, reviewing, and approving (or rejecting) them, releasing funds, making purchases, submitting invoices, verifying invoices, and recording purchases. Not trusting technology Organizations can be suspicious of using innovative technology to improve business processes over concerns regarding additional cost or security. They may use an online catalogue to search for needed items and an online shopping cart to create requisitions, but much more can be done by using specialised procurement technology. For example, by using procurement software, teams can reduce their requisition order cycles, requisition-to-order costs, and cut back on maverick spending. If you already have procurement technology deployed, contact your provider, and make sure that you are using the system to its full potential. Also, be open to opportunities to improving your processes by doing things such as switching to a third-party provider for managing your information technology systems. The road not taken may be well and good for poets, but procurement teams are wise to stick to the well-worn path. Processes are there for a reason to keep your teams on task and keep any surprises to a minimum. Stick to these tips for avoiding some of the most common and costly procurement mistakes, and you ll be glad you didn t cut any corners. https: procureability.com navigating-the-top-five-procurement-pitfalls-an-industry-experts-inside-guide",

    "text": "Gender Equity: Make the Most of Every Voice to Make an Impact As we come together to honor women and recognize their talents and contributions, we reflect on the progress we have made toward gender equity on International Women s Day (IWD) 2023 with a focus on EmbraceEquity. It is an opportune moment to take stock of all that has been achieved, while acknowledging there is still much more work required for us to truly achieve equality between genders. In the workplace, men continue to hold the lion s share of leadership positions, despite women graduating with advanced degrees at higher rates compared to men.1 Regarding pay equity, the gap between the median wages of women to men remains 82 cents per dollar.2 Socially, we are regressing on women s rights across the board. In Iran, a revolution is being led by girls and women to fight the attack on their most basic human rights: the right to choose, the right to free speech, and the right to protest. In Afghanistan, the Taliban continues to further restrict educational opportunities for girls and women. Even in the US, the legal right for women to access reproductive health care moved backwards with a recent Supreme Court decision. When you consider the effect of each of these pieces, the gaps are alarming. At the current rate of progress, it will take over 100 years to reach full parity on key dimensions benchmarked by the World Economic Forum.3 Because much works remains, there are many opportunities we can take to move the needle toward gender parity. The focus needs to be every day, year-round, to continue to make progress towards true equity. Advancing Gender Equality Every person can make a difference in fighting gender inequalities. Whether it be in your own life, in the workplace, or within your circle of influence every small step taken leaves an indelible mark on the path toward greater parity. Individually If you identify as a woman, advocate for yourself. When you do, share your success stories with other women. Stories of obstacles you overcame, that new salary or bonus you had the courage to negotiate, or how you made a career pivot into a new field. The more we share stories of advocating for ourselves, the more normal it becomes. Advocate for other women: open those doors for which you have the key. Intentionally support women-owned businesses. Even stories of hardship, such as a boundary that is continually violated, or a physical or mental health challenge you might be experiencing, help us realize that we are not alone and should not undermine our ability to overcome difficulty. Women especially should be aware of Impostor Syndrome so we can put our best selves into the world. Shift problematic language into a new thought. You control your own thoughts and can pivot to a perspective of abundance. Recognize your accomplishments, reflect on your opportunities for gratitude, and practice self-compassion. If you identify as a man, be receptive to the stories and experiences of women. Look for opportunities that remove barriers or enable a woman s progress. Advocate for women at every level. Read up on topics that discuss gender equity. Education is a critical part in achieving gender parity. In the Workplace Join your company s Women s Employee Resource Group (ERG). At ProcureAbility, our leadership-supported ERG is focused on community building and advancing the women in our organization. Within your organization s Women s ERG, there are a world of opportunities that can enable you to find community with other women in your organization and grow personally and professionally. If your organization does not have a Women s ERG, raise your hand and charter one yourself. Establish program goals, roles, initiatives, and appoint an executive sponsor. Implement Lean In Circles at your company. Check out these resources on how to implement Circles at your own workplace. Look for opportunities to host events that build community and provide a forum to share experiences. ProcureAbility recently co-hosted the Women in Procurement Dinner at the ProcureCon Indirect West Conference. Our event was held to celebrate the successes of women leaders in procurement and spark conversation for building what we have yet to accomplish. Our dialogue centered around being bold and creating that which we wish to see in the world . In sharing our stories, we draw strength and are reminded that we are not alone. In the Community Support a non-profit that aligns with that which you wish to see in the world. Give your time and talents to organizations for which you are passionate. Spread awareness about the causes you care about. Invite others to join and serve with you. The more we share, the more action we can create toward closing the equity gap. Anywhere, Any Time Champion, mentor, and sponsor: if you are in a position of influence, serve as a mentor or sponsor to a woman in your organization or community. You don t have to be formally labeled with a title to positively impact someone s life. The opportunity to provide guidance or enable another woman s success can be pivotal to her life and career and be incredibly rewarding for you. Regardless of your role, be an advocate for women. If you see discriminatory actions or diminutive language being used, call it out and address it head-on. Amplify the voices of women around you. Ensure they are heard, and they get a seat at the table. Create meaningful access to opportunities for women. Commit to the Long Game No matter how small, each action taken is a step towards progress. Keep speaking up, having conversations, and sharing stories to show your support for gender equity initiatives. Voices must also translate into action for those in position of influence and power: providing equal pay for equal work and equal access to all opportunities. It takes consistent effort from people of all genders to bridge the gaps that currently exist and reach true equality. Together we can create change if we stay committed to EmbraceEquity throughout the year not just one day in March.

    "text": "Attending a Conference? Make the Most of Your Investment Conference season provides excellent opportunities for in-person networking and professional growth. Keep in mind though that conferences cost time and money. It s worth asking how you can make the most out of the events on your schedule. Here are some of our favorite tips for optimizing your investment. Plan Ahead As with many things in life, maximizing your experience at a conference requires thoughtful preparation. Set goals Take time to think about your objectives before the conference starts. What do you want to achieve? Who do you want to meet? What do you want to learn? Clear goals will serve as a roadmap to decide which sessions to attend and set a strategy for how you network. Connect in advance Are there specific people that you want to try to meet with? If so, reach out in advance and ask for a time to say hello in person. Leverage your network to make new connections. Can a mutual friend or colleague make an introduction on your behalf? Preview the schedule Not every session will be important, so pick topics that align with your goals. Familiarize yourself with the conference map and keep one handy over the course of the event. Make a plan Making an agenda or scheduling the day in your calendar can help you to keep track of appointments and the sessions you don t want to miss. This can also help you when trying to coordinate time with people you may meet at the conference. Make time for yourself Don t forget to block out some free time to take a break, walk around, and explore. The best part of a conference might be the thing you randomly stumble upon. Pack Mindfully Conferences can be very loud, bright, crowded environments, and what you bring with you can make the difference between an uncomfortable grind and a painless, productive experience. Be comfortable Pack shoes you can wear all day and clothes that make you comfortable and confident. You might also want to bring a pair of ear plugs or noise cancelling earbuds: An event like NAMM has a decibel level at the high end of what s good for us, and you might need a break from the noise at some point. Notebooks and business cards With so much activity, it can be easy to lose track of what was discussed with who or what you learned at a session. Always carry something to take notes. Bring business cards to distribute to your new connections or be ready to share electronic business cards on your phone with a tap or QR code. Health Although regulations and restrictions have been lifted, conventions are large gatherings of people in proximity. Bring basic health safety essentials like hand sanitizer and as appropriate, face masks. Be Present Stay focused on the conference and the people around you. Set your out of office indicating the conference you are attending, block the time on your calendar, and try not to use your cell phone as a means of avoiding new connections. Location, location, location Staying on property allows you to meet as many as people as possible and partake in off-hour networking opportunities like early morning yoga, charity sporting events, and evening dinners. Sit with a new person at each event! Be a conversationalist Be ready for a succinct (and interesting!) summary about your company and you as an individual. Have interesting and timely questions in your back pocket to engage new people and get them talking. Did they recently travel to a new country, take up a new hobby, join a new professional organization? Then, listen! Remember first names by immediately using in the conversation. Stay organized Make time after each session or interaction to take notes. Write a sentence or two about what you heard or the person you just met. Transfer contact information to your notes or digital contact book and use tags to keep organized. Find a quiet space Stake out a spot away from the bustle of the conference for your prescheduled appointments and for impromptu conversations. Consider booking a hotel room with a separate living space, a conference room, or perhaps a table at a nearby restaurant. If those aren t options, find a spot within the conference grounds where foot traffic is less. Social Media Follow the conference event online, leverage the conference app to connect with other attendee, and share your experiences at the conference on LinkedIn or other social media platforms it s a great way to reconnect with existing contacts and make new ones. Look after yourself Your personal well-being is important. Make sure you get a healthy amount of sleep, stay hydrated, and don t be afraid to skip an event if you need time to recharge. Arrive for the beginning and stay for the duration Arrive on time so you quickly warm up and get into the swing of the conference. Stay until the end, when many of the best topics, and many of the best conversations, occur. Follow-up To make the most of a conference, you need to put in some work after the event is over and everyone has gone home. Reach out Make sure to reach out to the people you ve met within a few days after the conference. Use your notes to make your communications personal. If you want to foster a relationship with an important connection, ask for a face-to-face meeting or suggest a phone call. Connect on LinkedIn! Teach Share what you ve learned. Let your colleagues know what you heard at the conference and who you met. Not only will this help enrich your organization, but it will also help you cement your conference experiences in your memory. A final note on gratitude: We should all appreciate the opportunity to invest in ourselves by attending industry conferences in-person to learn, expand our network, and grow professionally.

    "text": "Part One Managing Spend in Inflationary Times: Collaboration Creates Transparency Intense inflationary pressure was the most significant challenge procurement leaders had to grapple with in 2022 and even if 2023 sees some relief as anticipated, inflation will remain an ongoing challenge to address. Severe supply-and-demand imbalances will take time to smooth out as the world continues to recover from the pandemic and other developments. However, it s also the case that individual components of the consumer price index and other measures of inflation have very different trajectories. Consider the performance of metals this year. At one extreme, we saw cold-rolled steel prices plunge 28 percent at the end of 2022. On the other end, high-grade aluminum prices surged 8.8 percent.1 28 plunge of cold-rolled steel prices 8.8 surged high-grade aluminum prices Given this extreme market volatility, procurement organizations have found themselves on the receiving end of repeated supplier price increases. This two-part ProcureAbility Insights series will help procurement leaders to ease the current pressure they may be feeling. Here, in Part One, we ll discuss how collaboration and increasing cost awareness across organizations can give procurement teams more power. In our companion piece, you ll find specific ways of managing and mitigating inflationary risk once that information is available. Working across functions As a department responsible for leveraging the collective strength of the organization, procurement has a unique opportunity to work closely with other business units, such as finance, engineering, and operations. Collaboration between different parts of an organization and its external suppliers can help create transparency regarding spending. Partnering together allows a better understanding of how individual cost components impact the overall price. This drives more successful negotiations with suppliers and a better understanding of where savings can be captured. For example, partnering with operations to determine if there is sufficient inventory to engage in elastic purchase timing or collaborating with engineering to unify product specifications can allow for a more proactive approach to purchasing within market volatility. Strategy for success: Deconstructing the RFP Requests for Proposals (RFPs) are an ideal proving ground for organizations to collaborate and increase price transparency. When developing an RFP, think about structuring it in a way that gives insights into the unpredictable market. This can be done by deconstructing the RFP into various cost elements, such as raw materials, labor, shipping, profit, overhead, and other factors that impact the cost of goods and services. Strategically deconstructing the RFP will give procurement teams a better understanding of where costs originate from and how they can be reduced. To capitalize on cost-saving opportunities, organizations should create and maintain an internal record of supplier quotations by each expense category. This will help them identify which types of spending can be subject to price fluctuations and devise suitable strategies accordingly. Furthermore, they must review these high-impact levers actively during future negotiations or routine business reviews to encourage a collaborative dialogue aimed at discussing any visible market patterns as well as their possible consequences. Procurement benefit: Stronger supplier visibility One of the most significant advantages of this strategy is that it creates improved visibility into the depths of your supply chain. As you gain more transparency in suppliers cost structure, you can also discover ways to reduce those costs. Additionally, this collaborative effort helps nurture stronger relationships with suppliers as it demonstrates an interest in understanding their business and working together for mutual benefit. This strategy can also improve supplier performance as they are given more visibility into the organization s expectations and how they can successfully and efficiently meet them. By utilizing this approach, you can experience a range of immediate advantages including the forging of stronger ties with suppliers, improved comprehension of cost data and more effective usage resources. Short-term Recommendations: Review and update the RFP process to provide greater visibility into cost components Implement internal and external supplier communications strategy that promotes the value of collaboration and transparency Train the procurement team on how to leverage this information The Long-term Recommendations: Implementing and monitoring for adherence to the communications strategy Open and collaborative business reviews to reinforce procurements vision for transparency and collaboration Developing a rich repository of supplier information and feedback that can be analyzed and leveraged to continually create efficiencies Longer term, these practices can be reviewed to improve their effectiveness and ensure that suppliers are adhering to the established policies to help manage the spend in inflationary times. Organizations must take a proactive role and practice risk management for successful control of the budget during inflationary periods. In our Part Two of our Insights, we will explore how to recognize potential risks related to unstable market climates and suggest strategies on keeping your business s financial health intact in these trying times.

    "text": "Part Two Managing Spend in Inflationary Times: Risk Mitigation Strategies Inflation may be starting to slow in parts of the economy, and cooling demand has taken some stress off supply chains. However producer prices continued to surpass forecasts in the latest report from the Labor Department, and at 7.4 percent annualized1, remain stubbornly high. Periods of sustained, high inflation can be crippling to procurement organizations that don t have a plan of attack for dealing with it. In our first installment of this two-part Insights series, we examined how information is power when it comes to addressing inflation, and why procurement teams must work across their organizations to better understand cost inputs to boost transparency and negotiating power. Now we ll explore five tactical steps procurement leaders can take to pass on price increases and build in enough flexibility to mitigate the impact of inflation on the bottom line. In addition to the potential for significant cost savings, these moves have ancillary benefits of increasing price visibility across the supply chain and improving relations with suppliers. Stagger supplier contracts Diversification isn t just for investment portfolios. By proactively managing contracts and employing strategic approaches, procurement can effectively spread out the risk of inflation biting all at the same time. This may involve staggering or differentiating supplier contracts across various durations, buying channels, pricing methods, and comparable market indices to limit exposure to sudden increases in commodity or labor costs. Adopt periodic price adjustments Once supplier contracts are put on a staggered renewal schedule to mitigate the short-term risks tied to inflation, procurement can proactively ensure their organization s long-term success by analyzing services and material purchases for risk exposure and adopting a periodic price adjustment schedule. Creating a methodology and cadence for pricing updates allows both parties to plan and budget accordingly, leading to far more efficient procurement process. The key to success here is transparency: agreeing to automatic pricing updates using pre-determined terms can reassure suppliers that their contract prices are being updated fairly and consistently, enhancing the cooperative partnership. Incorporate indexes into pricing In our first article, we highlighted the benefits of collaborating across the organization to better understand how individual cost components impact the overall price and manage them accordingly. Incorporating indices into contracts can work hand-in-hand with deconstructed pricing strategies because of the added element of visibility that they provide. Deconstructed pricing helps procurement better understand suppliers pricing strategies, while index-based price adjustments provide a way to share risk when prices trend up or down. Combined, these practices provide a solid foundation for protecting interests in inflationary environments against existing contracts. In the long term, incorporating indices or other stabilizing mechanisms into new and existing contracts can help protect against sudden, unexpected price changes. Establish tolerance thresholds To achieve benefits in the short-term, procurement departments can establish a price risk tolerance level within the organization using a specialized team or technology to closely monitor the situation and alert when that level has been breached. By implementing tolerance thresholds, procurement departments can proactively manage risk and negotiate contracts to secure the most favorable prices through this mechanism of renegotiation. Evaluate opportunities to increase inventory Under normal operating conditions, carrying too much inventory can be a costly mistake. But when inflation is running persistently high, there may be periods where procurement organizations need to pounce on relative bargains to protect against future spikes. Each organization needs a strategy for monitoring their operating needs and optimizing their inventory in a way that accounts for changes in select pricing measures or overall inflation. Those that are successfully able to anticipate and activate dynamic inventory levels stand a far greater change to mute the impact of short-term price fluctuations on their bottom lines. Getting aligned for better results Taken together, these steps should empower procurement organizations to strengthen their inflation-protection defenses through price transparency and active risk management. The first ensures that all participants see the benefits of thinking more strategically along these lines, while the second empowers decision makers across the organizations to all pull in the same direction. That kind of alignment isn t all that common, creating a point of competitive differentiation for those organizations that get this right.

    "text": "Procurement Organizations of the Future: Rebranding from Tactical to Strategic As your procurement organization goes through a transformation, it is essential to consider what is needed for this evolution and how you want your colleagues to view your contributions. To be recognized and valued as a strategic business partner, versus seen as tactical order takers, you will need to undertake an internal rebranding effort. Considerations for shifting your internal brand from tactical to strategic Communicate the changes to everyone in the organization Communication is critical to ensure all employees are aware of the positive changes in procurement and the beneficial implications for their teams. This should be done through a strategic communication plan which targets key internal partners and includes tailored messaging to their interests and involvement. This messaging can be done across a variety of mediums including company-wide memos, emails, and meetings. It is vital to make clear that these improvements aim to make procurement more strategic in adding value to the business. Communicating these planned changes will make the overall transition smoother for all those involved and reduce employee disruption during this transition. Remember that you win hearts and minds with every interaction that each of your team members has with internal stakeholders during the procurement transformation. Ensure employees are aware of available resources Create a culture of providing the right resources to the right people at the right time. Ensuring employees know who they need to contact for different requests such as purchasing new equipment, submitting invoices, or getting approval for a project simplifies the process. Providing colleagues with the answers and approvals they need promptly helps to improve your procurement organization s reputation. Start new paragraph with: Take advantage of self-service options and documented resources to make the department more efficient. This can include user-friendly online portals where employees can submit requests for various procurement functions and track their progress. This will reinforce the new brand of procurement, increase the efficiency of the department, and improve morale throughout the entire procurement rebranding. Also consider creating in-person and virtual office hours or designating Center of Excellence experts that people can lean on for help. Eliminate red tape Reducing the bureaucracy and streamlining the procurement process will make it easier for employees to do their jobs and to see procurement as a valued strategic partner. By eliminating unnecessary and redundant process steps, you can condense the process timeline which will reduce the workload of both the procurement department and key internal partners. These efficiencies also increase compliance with the process and avoid having employees that operate outside of the approved process. This can be accomplished by automating repetitive tasks, simplifying the approval process through authority spend limits, setting clear and defined guidelines, publishing necessary documentation in an easily accessible location, simplifying the approval process, and creating a culture of continuous process improvement. By removing the red tape during the procurement rebranding process, the entire organization will bу able to work more efficiently and effectively. Keep in mind, the overarching strategic goal is to make it as easy as possible for internal business partners to come to procurement and to go through the established channels. To achieve this, it is critical to bring the entire organization on the journey. Once you have made changes to the procurement process, ensure all employees know how the new system works and its benefits. Hold formal training sessions so that everyone has a clear understanding of the new procedures and to answer any outstanding questions. Employee feedback should also be encouraged outside of these formal training sessions to quickly identify and rectify any potential problems with the new system. This education will help ensure a smooth transition. Be flexible If you receive feedback or comments, make sure to address those with the individual who raised them and to incorporate them into the new process if it makes sense. In this way, you allow your internal stakeholders to feel heard and part of the process. Be patient The process of rebranding procurement within an organization can be challenging and extended. It may take months or even years to change how employees see procurement and to have them consider procurement a valuable strategic partner. However, with patience and perseverance, the value of procurement will be seen and appreciated. During this rebranding time, organizations should strive for excellence and always remember that the end goal is the collective success of the company. Procurement organizations of the future make continuous incremental progress, consider all feedback, and communicate effectively with the goal of adding consistent, strategic value to the business. https: procureability.com rebranding-from-tactical-to-strategic",

    "text": "Procurement Organizations of the Future: Measuring the Success of Procurement Rebranding Efforts Rebranding your procurement department within your organization is a significant and important undertaking for your long-term success. The positioning of your procurement organization s transformation from tactical to strategic is a critical part of the internal messaging required to communicate the increased value your activities drive for the business. Planning a procurement rebrand Determining appropriate and attainable goals and metrics to measure your progress is the essential first step to quantifying your return on investment (ROI) and communicating your success internally. You should plan to measure several KPIs including: Increased visibility of the procurement department Improved relationships with other departments Increased participation in strategic initiatives Improved stakeholder satisfaction Secondly, you need to create an execution plan for how you will achieve these goals. This most likely will involve: Training employees on the new procurement process Creating and implementing an organization-wide communication plan Improving the department s existing systems and procedures You need to implement your plan and closely manage progress to determine what adjustments need to be made. Monitoring progress against your goals and fine-tuning the strategy as you go will ensure continued success. Finally, you should celebrate your success, publicize achieved changes, and keep working to maintain the new procurement brand. By following these steps, you can ensure your procurement rebranding efforts are successful and recognized. Increased visibility One of procurement s rebranding goals is to increase visibility within the organization. This can be measured by tracking how often employees interact with procurement or by surveying how they perceive the department. Either way, increasing visibility is key to getting employees to understand and appreciate what procurement does for the company. Procurement s rebranding efforts may include updates to the department s website and resources or other changes that can help increase employees perception of procurement and make it easier for them to identify and interact with the department. By increasing the visibility of your procurement department during the rebranding process, you can build credibility and a stronger foundation for your department s future success while demonstrating your strategic value to the business. Improved internal relationships Another goal of rebranding procurement is to improve your internal relationships by being valued as a strategic internal partner. This can be measured by tracking the number of requests for assistance from other departments or by surveying employees to see how efficiently procurement can assist with their requests. Other measurements are nuanced such as improved relationships with other departments that lead to more efficient and coordinated partnership on projects and increased overall satisfaction with procurement within the organization. Increased participation in strategic initiatives As procurement becomes more strategic, you can expect to see an increase in its participation in firm-wide initiatives. Procurement s increased participation in strategic activities helps to drive success during rebranding through more effective engagement with other departments, more efficient operations, and improved communication. As a result, companies rely on their procurement organizations to help create more streamlined and value-driving efforts for the business. Higher internal satisfaction An improvement in employees satisfaction with your procurement department often follows successful transformation and rebranding initiatives. The rebranding of your procurement department will result in increased efficiency and productivity in other departments as they lean on your expertise and contributions to add value for their operations. Measuring the success of your efforts can be challenging, but it is essential to continue making progress and building upon your internal brand. Using the framework outlined, you can track how well your procurement organization of the future performs against your goals and make changes as necessary throughout the procurement rebranding process. https: procureability.com measuring-the-success-of-procurement-rebranding-efforts",

    "text": "Cost Management in a Volatile Market Environment Inflationary pressure, price increases and force majeure are concepts that supply chain professionals are becoming intimately familiar with these days. While this month s purchasing managers index (PMI) showed some deceleration in manufacturers input costs, broad gauges of inflation, such as the consumer price index, are the highest they ve been in four decades. Supply shortages and disruptions remain, more than two years after the start of the global pandemic. Manufacturers input costs showed some deceleration due to purchasing managers index (PMI) Consumer price index as one of the broad gauges of inflation is now the highest in 4 decades Against this backdrop, suppliers are asking for the one thing that procurement professionals most dread: compensation for inflation. Managing these requests while avoiding strains in supplier relations can be tricky. Given this, we thought it would be a good time to share some best practices we ve developed at ProcureAbility from our firm s more than 25 years of experience focused on supporting procurement teams. We ll break them down into four areas for managing such requests responding to an initial request, processing a request, requesting supplier information, and reaching an agreement with an eye toward providing a basic roadmap for responding. Responding to an initial request Supplier price increase requests can come in an email, a phone call or, in rare cases, an update to invoices. It s important to acknowledge that you ve received the request from the supplier and let them know that you will respond within a specified amount to time. This is all about managing expectations while sending a signal that you re giving their request the attention it deserves. The more transparent you can be about how much time you will need to respond, and what information you need to gather to respond, the better. This will also put the issue squarely on your to-do list so it doesn t snowball and become a bigger issue that compromises the supply base. Now, it might be that you feel there is enough information to authorize an acceptance or rejection of their proposal right off the bat. The supplier might even push you and your organization to decide quickly, using whatever leverage they have. Resist this. An immediate rejection could be perceived as a lack of care in maintaining the relationship. Taking the time your organization needs to fully assess the request sends the opposite signal. It says your organization is methodical and analytical in processing such requests and won t jump the gun or be pushed around. Processing a request Make sure you know what the supplier is asking of your company. It might be a material pass-through or an adjustment for higher labor costs or freight compensation. It could be a combination of these factors. It s important to understand the drivers of the request so your management team can make the best decision. Work to understand what financial impact it will have on your company s bottom line if accepted, and how you might be able to absorb it. Maybe the sales team has agreed to pass such increases onto the customer. If that s not the case, you need to know now so you can assess how the price increase is likely to impact your internal financial goals. That information could prove quite valuable if you need to make a case for rejecting the request. Be sure not to take all of this on by yourself. Alert your team, bringing in your category manager, sales team, and other stakeholders. They might be able to provide insights into the types of information such as indexing data and broad inflationary trends you can use as a benchmark against the requested price increase. Your team can also help you understand how critical the supplier is to your business and the level of negotiating leverage. What is the size of this supplier relative to your company? Are they sole sourced? Is there more upcoming business to award? These are the types of question you and your team should be asking as you consider the request and weigh how aggressive to be in responding. In pursuit of these answers, create two separate lists, one containing items needed internally and one listing items needed from the supplier. Some examples are listed below: Requesting supplier information When seeking information from the supplier, be sure to emphasize how important they are as a partner. This is especially important when dealing with sole-source providers, but all suppliers should be made to feel important. Make it abundantly clear that you won t be able to decide on the request until you ve received the information you seek. Avoid setting a deadline until you have these items. When it is furnished, make sure you understand what they have presented and ask questions if necessary. Before you move into your final negotiation on the request, ensure the supplier has explored all other avenues to mitigate cost. There may be an alternative, mutually beneficial outcomes that haven t been offered, or perhaps haven t been considered, by the supplier. Questions you might consider asking to this end would include: Is there room in other areas for cost reduction? What about alternative materials or new processes? Reaching an agreement After you have reviewed all the information that you requested and received, create a document to help guide your negotiations with the supplier. Your discussions with the supplier should stress the impact that their request will have on the company, so it s important to fully understand and explain the financial outcomes tied to accepting or declining the request or finding an alternate solution. Remember: neither your company nor the supplier should have to assume the full burden of the cost increase. In making your case, cite the information that supports compromise. Avoid framing the negotiations from the standpoint of winning or losing. When making your counter proposal, consider whether the terms might be adjusted to buy you some relief. For instance, you might grant their increased compensation for a limited amount of time or start it at a future date. You might also consider capping inflationary increases to a specified percentage going forward or using index agreements as a guide. Whatever path you propose, explain your reasoning and draw support from the information you were provided. If you ve followed the steps above, this part of the process should go smoothly. If it doesn t, it might be time to reappraise your relationship with the supplier. Every successful company has successful partners who want to work with you, not exploit you. If you find you re not dealing with an honest broker, it s probably time to move on. https: procureability.com cost-management-in-a-volatile-market-environment",

    "text": "Strategic Sourcing Solutions: Wildfire Mitigation When it comes to wildfire risk, sourcing can play a key role in mitigating the potential for disaster. In recent years, the number of wildfires in California has increased significantly, with many igniting on days that don t have red flag warnings. This is an immediate concern to be addressed by utilities companies considering that 2022 has been the driest year the area has been in the past 127 years. This significant trend is likely to continue, making it even more critical for utility providers operating in high-fire risk areas to take steps to reduce the potential for ignition. However, creating a comprehensive strategy and plan to minimize fire potential is not a one-step process. Instead, efforts should be focused on implementing a new, multi-step sourcing approach that: Ramps up the volume of available resources to complete projects in unprecedented time frames. Negotiates unit pricing contracts with partners to support 2022 goals. Unitizes vegetation management, transmission pole replacement, overhead system hardening, and other projects to optimize costs. Develops a long-term sourcing strategy for undergrounding program and creating deep and lasting partnerships. Reduce Potential Wildfires One way that electricity providers can reduce the potential for wildfire damage is by investing in enhanced vegetation management programs. These programs focus on removing trees and other vegetation that pose a high risk of igniting fires and can involve advanced technologies, like drones, to identify areas with a high risk for wildfires. Plan 2022 1,800 Miles targeted 365,000 Trees targeted 80 Targeting of our work on the top 20 highest risk circuits Benefits of EVM work Reduces potential for ignitions Improves customer reliability Our recent success with an electric provider enabled them to ramp up crews rapidly and in unprecedented volume to meet commitments to its community despite shortages of qualified labor. Early in our partnership, ProcureAbility helped to rapidly develop and conduct unit price RFP for tree-trimming partners and strategically negotiated labor rates that supported the mass scaling of pre-inspectors. As the multi-year program matured, it enabled the client to control costs by shifting to a defined scope approach and meet budget challenges. This program enabled the completion of large trenches of work within budget constraints and massive scaling to meet risk-mitigation targets for this project. With a strategy for effective source and right-sizing to ensure a pool of qualified, scalable, and safe partners, the client was able to nearly double annual tree-work and pre-inspection spend. Undergrounding Distribution Powerlines As the best long-term solution, utilities are investing in undergrounding projects. This helps prevent wildfires from igniting, as there is no longer a pathway for sparks to travel from the powerlines to the ground, resulting in nearly a 99 reduction in the risk of a fire igniting. One electric provider has set the ambitious, yet necessary, goal to underground 10,000 miles of powerlines. By 2026, this provider aims to have nearly one-third of this goal met. However, to effectively and successfully complete this project, they have needed to rethink their sourcing to drive down the price of undergrounding from 3.75 million per mile to 2.5 million by 2026. Creative sourcing solutions will be the key to achieving this goal. Increase in annual volume from 2021-2022 est. 650 M in 2022 spend Increase in annual volume from 2021-2026 250 M in 2021 to est. 3B year in 2026 Drive Cost Predictability and Control At the heart of these strategies to mitigate wildfire risk is a focus on driving cost predictability and control. Strategic sourcing solutions are instrumental in these efforts. For example, utilities can move away from time and equipment-based billing for non-emergency work. This type of billing can often lead to higher costs, as businesses are charged for the time it takes to complete a task, regardless of whether it could have been completed more quickly. Instead, companies should focus on value-based billing, which charges based on the results achieved. This type of billing can help ensure that businesses are only paying for the work that is being done rather than for the time it takes to complete the work. At the same time, having a right-sized pool of reliable and safe contractors can ensure they can meet evolving needs. Building an effective sourcing strategy contributes to effective wildfire mitigation. Below are several ways that sourcing can shape strategy and empower businesses: Competitively priced products and services that maximize your buying power and mitigate risk. The correct number and mix of safe, qualified, and scalable partners can deliver quality work while meeting responsibility and sustainability goals. Establishing contracts and purchasing vehicles that are easy to administer that protect your interests. Get actionable insight into mitigating potential and ongoing market risks, leveraging opportunities, and implementing recommendations. Allow space and flexibility in your sourcing strategy to create opportunity for innovation over the program s lifetime. Mitigating wildfire is a collaborative effort between utility providers and sourcing partners. It s also important to note that these efforts don t always provide immediate results. This means that finding the right sourcing partners will help to build long-term strategies for success. https: procureability.com strategic-sourcing-solutions-wildfire-mitigation",

    "text": "Conrad SnoverCEO Supplier Management Strategies for Mitigating Supply Chain Disruptions Supply diversification in the utilities sector As supply chain disruptions related to the global pandemic have presented significant challenges for procurement teams across many industries, utilities have been better positioned than most. Just-in-time inventory was not a widely implemented strategy, so until now, utilities have avoided the worst as the global economy has conspired to bring supplies to market after-you-need-it. Grid resilience and recovery, along with commonplace regulatory frameworks, encouraged thoughtful, careful, and strategic procurement practices that evolved over time. As a result, utility procurement is characterized by steady but notable change that has led to a long-term sustainable model and historically provided insulation from supply chain snarls. However, it has recently become apparent that utilities are not immune from disruptions with shortages now commonplace in critical materials. Tighter alliances balanced with managed diversification Now faced with shortages, persistent inflation, and shipping bottlenecks, utility CPOs and procurement teams have been struggling to find the right balance between supplier alliances and sourcing diversity. Pre-pandemic, the pendulum had swung in favor of alliances. Procurement teams were enjoying the efficiencies of a sourcing strategy in which you commit to a supplier, and they give you a long-term commitment in return. There were clear advantages and efficiencies in a consolidated sourcing strategy that could leverage volume. Then, two and a half years ago, everything changed with the pandemic. Suddenly the value of diversification was seen in sharp relief, with organizations looking anywhere and everywhere to fill their needs. In the wake of the pandemic, we see our clients practicing more of a flex model (e.g., a 70 30 percentage mix) that retains alliance suppliers as a base while introducing additional suppliers in a backup position, while also utilizing the spot market to test pricing and secure ad-hoc, open production slots. A flex model does not discount the advantages of alliances, but rather creates a sourcing mix that adds resiliency and flexibility. When a port is closed or a supplier experiences raw material challenges, the procurement relationships exist to enable a seamless shift to alternative sources. Supplier diversification and resiliency have become even more critical to our industry over the past few years of turmoil amongst the backdrop of global interdependence. Let s explore an example of a successful flex model implemented to mitigate market and economic uncertainties. Primary supplier Your primary strategic supplier, with whom there is a high-level of mutual reliance and potential impact, makes up approximately 60-80 of your business. This is a supplier where both parties are committed to a strong, symbiotic partnership where executive alignment at the highest levels exists and is supported. Your primary supplier engages with you on strategic endeavors including long-term purchasing commitments, potentially with joint R D and product development investments, as well as with the collaborative creation of design alternatives (e.g., lighter weight and different pole mounts). You may also co-develop intellectual property commitments to enable your supplier to make capital investments and expand production capacity into new facilities. As a best practice, a utility company should establish SLAs with the supplier to commit to minimum on-time delivery rates and provide a legal option to end the agreement if those expectations are not met. In today s market of constrained materials, these alliance relationships have become even more critical. Some suppliers suffering manufacturing slowdowns due to shortages in labor and raw materials are electing not to participate in RFPs or renegotiations. Other suppliers are only working with their alliance partners. Secondary suppliers Back-up suppliers comprise 20-40 of your transaction volume. These partners allow you to be flexible with your fluctuating volume needs by providing excess capacity as needed with the security of supplier diversification. Transactional suppliers Your remaining suppliers will provide your business with up to 10 of transaction volume by offering both access to spot buys to take advantage of excess market capacity and constant monitoring of the spot market. If there is any disruption with these transactional suppliers, there will be little to no interruption in your supply chain ecosystem. Utilities unique positioning and opportunities In many ways, supply chain issues play out differently in the utility industry compared to other parts of the economy; consider historical mutual assistance calls that share crews and equipment during emergencies. A utility company that has come through a natural disaster might be able to borrow scarce distribution transformers or other materials from a neighboring utility. This is in sharp contrast to what happened in healthcare during the pandemic, when companies closely guarded supplies of personal protective equipment. Faced with persistent supply chain concerns, procurement has risen in importance and often has the attention of the CEO and even the Board. Today s opportunity allows the creativity and innovation of supply chain teams to come to the fore and offers a chance to make an impact in every part of the organization. https: procureability.com supplier-management-strategies-for-mitigating-supply-chain-disruptions",

    "text": "Conrad SnoverCEO Utility Supply Management Association (USMA) conference 2022 Over the last 2 years, we ve missed the opportunity to consistently and meaningfully connect in person with our peers, partners, and industry leaders; as such, I am more grateful than ever to have had the opportunity to make new connections and cultivate existing relationships at the Utility Supply Management Association (USMA) conference in May in Austin, TX. Our conference team included me, Kayla Rice, Rhiana Gallen, and Kathleen Pomento. To add to the excitement and energy of the event being the first in-person conference for USMA since 2019, it also was the largest in history (with over 500 attendees), with some of the best speakers and sessions I ve experienced. This unique event provided the opportunity to have thought provoking discussions with other utility industry leaders on the supply chain disruptions we are encountering today and how we can mitigate the risk of continued disruption. To summarize our team s time in Austin, I ve recapped the keynote sessions, our own ProcureAbility-led sessions, and the quality of the networking event on the final evening. Keynote Sessions Speakers Highlights William McRaven Admiral USN (Retired) Gave a riveting talk on leadership and his learnings from his time in the US Navy, highlighting his countless notable achievements, including leading operational control of Navy SEAL Team Six s successful mission to eliminate Osama bin Laden, the world s most wanted terrorist leader at the time. John Sitilides US State Department Advisor Discussed geopolitical threats and the related supply chain impacts, including realized and potential impacts of the war in Ukraine, tensions between China and Hong Kong, and much more. Vivek Wadhwa American Technology Entrepreneur, Academic and Author Briefed the group on technology and the electric utility, highlighting emerging technologies, risks, and potential mitigations. ProcureAbility Presentations During the conference s breakout sessions, our team had the privilege of co-presenting with our valued client partners on two topics: Innovative Sourcing and Supplier Development Strategies for O M Cost Reduction: Top of mind for many organizations (beyond just utilities) is the new normal for procurement, how to establish an O M cost management program and maximizing O M impact through category management and supplier development. In this session, we shared case studies from our partnerships with utility clients, best practices, and fostered thoughtful discussion amongst the attendees on what they are experiencing in their organizations. Sourcing s Role in Wildfire Mitigation: In the face of increasingly frequent and devastating natural disasters, sourcing has a critical opportunity to enable its organizations to dramatically alter the asset landscapes in which they operate by strategically sourcing safe, cost effective, system-wide solutions to mitigate wildfire risk (including vegetation management, system hardening, undergrounding, enhanced tools and technology, and more). In this session, we discussed how sourcing s strategy, role, and impact can evolve throughout the maturity of risk mitigation programs; approaches to sourcing for mega-programs and helping shape organizational strategy; as well as sharing case studies from our partnerships with clients. I enjoyed the smoothly executed, rich conference hosted by USMA. Our ProcureAbility team deeply valued the opportunity to reconnect and meet with suppliers and utility contacts alike. The information shared, discussions facilitated, and connections forged were that which triumphed any USMA conference I ve personally attended in recent years, and I am looking forward to next year already. I would like to thank my colleagues Rhiana, Kayla, and Kathleen for attending the conference and representing ProcureAbility so well. https: procureability.com utility-supply-management-association-usma-conference-2022",

    "text": "Reducing O M Cost with Innovative Sourcing The New Normal for Procurement Procurement plays an increasingly important role in achieving corporate goals and objectives in the current business landscape. In the utility industry, this means creating value that supports the delivery of safe, reliable, affordable, and clean energy. The focus of procurement has shifted from simply reducing costs to delivering value in other areas such as quality, speed, performance, risk management, and supply assurance. Procurement is also responsible for operational aspects such as organization, efficiency, process, and customer service. At the same time, digital advancements have created new opportunities for procurement in areas such as automation, advanced analytics, systems integration, blockchain, and collaborative tools, which allow for even greater efficiency and effectiveness in an organization. To control and reduce Operational and Maintenance (O M) costs, utilities must focus on implementing innovative sourcing and supplier development strategies, measuring their proficiency, and reducing expenses. Develop O M Cost Reduction Strategies Operations Maintenance (O M) is focused on a utility s generation plants, distribution and transmission systems, and general and administrative expenses. These costs are typically represented by both labor and non-labor expenditures associated with running a utility, passed through to ratepayers without a profit markup, and recovered on a dollar-for-dollar basis, rather than gradually over time. The increases in O M costs are due to many factors including declining energy sales and revenues, inflation rates rising to the highest level in four decades, global uncertainties, wildfire mitigation, supply chain constraints, customer transparency, and risks associated with the Russia-Ukraine war. Plus, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and raw material shortages, there have been supply chain constraints that have resulted in increased costs for raw materials, finished goods, transportation, and logistics. Measuring proficiency, and ultimately controlling O M costs, is paramount to maintaining healthy bottom lines and meeting shareholder expectations. To measure proficiency, many different metrics can be used, such as O M cost per megawatt-hour (MWh), O M cost per customer, O M cost per employee, or O M cost as a percentage of utility revenue. Utilities can track these metrics to benchmark their performance and develop strategies for improvement. The most important thing is to remain adaptable and responsive in this new landscape. With the right strategies in place, procurement can continue to play a vital role in keeping O M costs under control and ensuring utilities long-term success. Controlling O M Costs To mitigate these increases in O M costs, utilities must focus on cost control by implementing innovative sourcing and supplier development strategies. Such strategies include: Procuring long-term contracts. Partnering with other utilities to share resources. Working with energy service companies (ESCOs). By taking these steps, utilities can effectively control their O M costs and keep them from increasing further. This will help maintain healthy bottom lines and meet shareholder expectations. Organizations such as ProcureAbility can help develop and implement these innovative sourcing and supplier development strategies to help utilities control their O M costs. Implement an O M Cost Management Program When it comes to controlling and reducing O M costs, having a well-established program is critical and can help your company stay ahead of the curve. Applying a methodical framework to build, scale, and sustain O M cost management is the foundation for program success. To start, your company will need first to measure its proficiency. This can be done by looking at the O M cost per unit of energy produced (MWh), the number of customers serviced, the revenue generated, or the number of employees. Once you have a benchmark to work from, you can begin to implement changes that will help reduce costs. You can maximize O M impact by utilizing category management to: Increase overall value from the supply base service levels, availability, quality, and the value of money. Reduce the total cost of ownership of goods and services. Address and mitigate risk in the supply chain. Enable supplier capability development and encourage more innovation from the supplier. Effectively align and leverage internal resources to deliver to generate through cross-functional teamwork procurement outcomes that fully satisfy agreed business needs. Increase value capture through continuous monitoring. However, these O M cost reduction strategies need to be sustained to have a lasting and measurable impact. This includes getting full stakeholder involvement to develop a project pipeline and identify business opportunities. It also requires developing strategic relationships with suppliers to maximize value, drive efficiencies, and meet cost-reductions targets. Case Study: Reducing Full-service Management Consulting Spend For three years, a California-based utility company noticed a substantial increase in full-service management consulting spend, which highlighted the need for formalized internal governance to validate market rates and project classification. To achieve this goal, the company developed internal governance to: Review and approve all procurements with full-service management consultants and validate those internal resources were unavailable, consulting rates did not exceed a reasonable amount, and the scope warranted the suppliers. 19 YOY decrease in full-service management consulting spend and Executive visibility to business unit resource constraints resulting in the approval of additional job postings, as achieved result. Maximizing O M Impact through Category Management Category management organizes goods and services into categories that accurately represent how the business uses them to improve the overall value from the supply base service levels, availability, quality, and the value of money. Utilizing category management can help reduce the total cost of ownership of goods and services by addressing and mitigating risk in the supply chain, effectually aligning and leveraging internal resources to deliver procurement outcomes that fully satisfy agreed business needs. This can help organizations maximize O M impact by increasing value capture through continuous monitoring. By grouping goods and services into categories, businesses can more accurately represent how they use these items. Additionally, by utilizing category management, businesses can encourage supplier innovation and development, leading to even more significant cost savings in the future. Conclusion The bottom line is that by reducing your O M cost with innovative sourcing, your company can stay ahead of the curve, improve efficiency, and save money. Implementing supply chain management can help you effectively manage your inventory, reduce labor costs, and encourage supplier innovation. If you want to lower your O M cost, category management is an effective tool that can help you achieve long-term benefits and offers significant cost savings. By implementing these changes, your company can improve its bottom line and be more successful with sourcing in the future. https: procureability.com reducing-cost-with-innovative-sourcing",

    "text": "Procurement Analytics A World in Flux We are living in extraordinary times resulting in unprecedented challenges for our industry. Domestically, headwinds include historic levels of inflation, significant public policy developments, increasing regulatory requirements, and rising interest rates. Globally, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has spawned unparalleled sanctions, roiled markets, and changed demand patterns. But among these challenges, driven by rapidly evolving world events, are opportunities. Procurement organizations need to be alert to risk identification, which leads to risk management, identifying critical categories, and accelerating purchases. Measures to mitigate this business risk include expanding supplier lists to add: Additional sources of supply Reviewing order timings Shortening intervals to prepare for lengthening delivery cycles and monitoring the shifting Enhancing goods delivered inspection procedures Adding inventory security readiness measures THE CURRENT STATE OF SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT The supply chain is constantly evolving and adapting to changing market circumstances. In the current political climate, with new SEC regulations and increasing governmental scrutiny, procurement organizations need to be prepared for potential changes that could impact their supply chains. Today s unsettled environment renders monitoring of geopolitical events, both domestic and international, vital. The taut supply chain of just in time inventories has snapped into a just in case stock, where large amounts of inventory are kept on hand, causing many organizations to re-think their supply operations. One of the most significant potential impacts is re-shoring manufacturing operations to the US. This shift is driven by several factors, including concerns about rising costs and the availability of skilled labor in other countries. However, moving operations is not easy nor inexpensive, so this activity will stretch out in time and may likely represent diversified global operations that are better aligned with home-country political policies. These shifting activities present new opportunities for organizations to restructure and adapt their supply chains to accommodate these changes. In addition to shifting production capabilities, the continuing use of tariffs and other economic measures by governments to shape procurement activities requires careful monitoring for both compliance and strategic advantage. As supply chains work to adapt to changing conditions globally, structuring the supplier value chain to add transparency creates a key opportunity. It is likely that additional Scope 3 disclosures will be required through pending SEC action and putting tracking measures in place now will ensure that systems and data are available to support the new reporting. In addition, this is an excellent time to build up supplier relationships and consider how all of these changes will impact your partners throughout the supply chain. The changes to rules around auditing and disclosure could significantly increase reporting requirements, and many companies are still scrambling to figure out how to respond. HOW PROCUREMENT ORGANIZATIONS CAN PREPARE AND RESPOND To respond to the ever-evolving new normal, several measures are needed. 1 Assess exposure to risk and ensure a plan to mitigate potential impacts 2 Focus on the emerging changes and trends and adjust strategies accordingly 3 Implement greater tracking of public policy initiatives and developing regulations, and monitor the shifting political climate for potential impacts on trade Finally, procurement organizations should review supplier contracts and relationships to ensure that they are prepared for any changes on the horizon. Adding alternative sources of supply and strengthening agreements to protect against disruptions can provide resiliency. By taking these steps, organizations can better prepare for the evolving risks in the supply chain. Organizations that can react quickly and respond proactively to fast-moving events will be at a significant advantage in today s rapidly changing business environment. https: procureability.com a-world-in-flux",

    "text": "Global Supply Squeeze Intensifies Push for More Predictive Procurement WOULD YOU RATHER KNOW WHERE YOU VE BEEN OR WHERE YOU RE GOING? The question is as relevant to procurement leaders as it is to drivers on the road and the answer is just as obvious. Thanks to immense advances in artificial intelligence machine learning (AI ML) and other data analytics technologies, procurement is becoming a forward-looking function. With high and increasing degrees of accuracy, businesses today can predict not only when and where they will need critical supplies, but also where and when shortages or other issues are likely to surface, what to do to strengthen supplier contracts, and how much money will be saved from better procurement practices. It wasn t always this way. Three decades ago, procurement leaders forecasting abilities were severely constrained. Data wrangling and analysis were confined to Microsoft Excel spreadsheets that focused on past spending. The new millennium brought desktop spend analysis software, but information was limited to on-premise data located within the company s firewall. Changes over the past decade have enabled procurement teams to shift focus from the rear view to the horizon. Two big themes have dramatically strengthened their forecasting abilities. One, companies have grown comfortable with migrating to the cloud, facilitating access to more timely and more telling data sets. Two, ML- and AI-fueled analytics are enabling them to scenario plan in myriad ways, forecasting how changes in factors such as inflation, geopolitics, and even weather might alter the availability and pricing of critical raw materials. The challenge is, many procurement functions haven t availed themselves of these new capabilities, and that s become a major issue amid one of the most severe global supply shortages we ve ever experienced. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine, have upset supply and demand dynamics across industries, with ripple effects stretching far and wide. We ve all seen the images. Empty store shelves. Miles of idle container ships offshore waiting to unload. UPS and FedEx trucks racing around neighborhoods to dispatch online orders placed by remote workers and shut-in consumers. AMID THE TUMULT, PROCUREMENT LEADERS HAVE FELT AN OUTSIZED SHARE OF THE PAIN Some procurement leaders can t get what they need, some face long fulfilment cycle times while others pay through the nose. At the same time, they re dealing with unhappy customers or business partners waiting weeks for their purchases, or frustrated CEOs tired of lowering revenue forecasts specifically driven by supply shortages. In the race to catch up, many firms have reflexively reached for the nearest whiz-bang, off-the-shelf procurement technology solutions, hoping they ll solve its problems as soon as those applications are installed. It doesn t work that way. Many solutions are built by technologists focused on a specific platform, and don t incorporate the business realities that influence individual organizations. That includes workplace culture and resistance to change, one of the reasons why adoption rates for such solutions tend to be so low. There are also integration issues, as bolt-on technologies fail to work with existing systems and capture data needed for actionable insights. At ProcureAbility, we chose a different path taking the practitioner s view Our proprietary PureSpend technology solution uses integrated spend analytics tools to help procurement leaders undertake capacity analysis, rank risks to their supply chain and individual suppliers, and then deploys predictive analytics to enhance spend, price and market forecasting, and perform advanced cost modelling. When you create a category engine, you will set rules for variables such as price sensitivities, which fluctuate under different market conditions. The more data you feed into the engine, the more accurate its forecasts become for capacity utilization, procurement costs, and potential bottlenecks. Technology only takes you as far as the people who are supporting it. Our category experts work with our clients leadership teams to understand the what s critical to decision making so we can prioritize their most important procurement issues and address them. They constantly ask what if questions and analyze possible scenarios to help our clients get ahead of any issues and meet projections. In the current global supply crunch, finding the right procurement partner is like driving with GPS. As good as it is, we ve all been steered incorrectly at times. These days, you need not only the technology, but someone who knows the neighborhood and can course correct. That s what we do at ProcureAbility, and we can help you on your procurement journey.

    "text": "Procurement Analytics, Procurement Consulting, Supply Chain Management Three Essential Steps for Establishing Your Data Strategy Having a carefully thought-out data strategy is an essential part of any organization s success in today s environment. The data strategy drives culture and shapes future actions by providing an organization-wide understanding of what data is and how the company intends to leverage it. In a world mired in ever-evolving technologies around data ingestion, analysis, and reporting, it is harder than ever to right-size an organization s data strategy for their needs and goals. The ideal data strategy for any organization is one that allows for repeatable risk mitigation, forecast gains, and smart portfolio management. When creating an organizational data plan, consider why you collect this information, how you use it, whether you apply data insights (or don t), and what problem(s) it solves. You may find yourself in need of complex data techniques to address the issues your team faces. Procurement professionals are often intrigued by the benefits of emerging techniques like machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) rightfully so as these tools are among the most powerful and efficient in the data realm. The truth is that most procurement organizations often lack both enough data and the right kind of raw data to apply ML and AI to their spending or sourcing projects. Naturally, this makes it difficult to achieve any real breakthroughs in automation or improved efficiency on your own. Bleak as this may seem, there are effective ways to go about obtaining and applying the right kind of data to leverage these exciting technologies. THREE KEY STEPS FOR TO OPTIMIZE YOUR DATA STRATEGY STEP 1: Combine Available Data to Create an Internal Baseline Any given organization s data strategy must include a collection of intracompany data regarding specific goods and services. Information from internal stakeholders around why a product or service was chosen in the first place like ease and quickness, competitive intelligence, or promise of innovation could shape future purchases. By collecting this intracompany information from the outset, as well as recording data sources to refresh their dataset more easily, a given organization will be able to define their baseline current steady-state position. This step may include, but is not limited to, collection of supplier audit data, personal testimony from current innovation partners, and review of product or service issues alongside any available transactional data. STEP 2: Integrate Contextual Data Procurement organizations often get stuck in the process of utilizing transactional information without also gathering contextual data. Without tapping into external sources like third-party data (import export databases, monthly weekly adjustments to exchange rates, et cetera), governmental publications (i. e., the Energy Information Administration, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Census data, et cetera), and other relevant data points, these teams are missing out on crucial insights. Best-in-class procurement data strategies will take various relevant external data sources into account on an ongoing basis. As an example, for an organization that manages large volumes of corrugate packaging, they would be remiss not to utilize reports around pulp mills, follow the fluctuations in imports exports of pulp and paper products, and may even go as far as following fuel and transportation to fully develop their supply chain view. STEP 3: Utilize Relevant Data Techniques to Review and Analyze your Data By now you have your datasets and third-party reporting, you ve likely been able to uncover a few pain points for your organization and you re probably looking to transition to data analytics and forecasting. For companies who find themselves with disparate types of data, various data sources, or simply with particularly large datasets, your typical data analysis software may not be robust enough to make this analysis as quick and easy as needed. Traditionally, procurement analytics have focused on understanding past procurement spend and supplier performance, but increasingly the focus is shifting toward AI-driven prescriptive decision-making. This reflects an evolution from descriptive analytics to prescriptive analytics. While your organization may not have ML and AI expertise on-hand, we recommend that organizations assess the analytics-as-a-service products market for solutions. For example, ProcureAbility s analytics-as-a-service product, PureSpend, helps organizations to get to the next stage. With tailored dashboards, secured data warehousing, and a focus on client autonomy and data accessibility, our services support any number of client-requested data needs that can be refreshed at the click of a button.

    "text": "5 Best Practices for a Successful Software Contract Negotiation in 2022 As 2021 comes to a close and the focus shifts to the coming new year, your organization may be setting its sights on new large-scale software systems. Whether you are upgrading a legacy system or considering a new one altogether, this is an important decision with long term strategic implications for your company. Having a bullet-proof sourcing strategy is imperative to ensure a successful negotiation, implementation, and long-term adoption of an enterprise software system (ERP, CRM, HCM). In this blog, we will lay out our best practices for how to source and negotiate enterprise software agreements with confidence. Best Practice 1: Don t Go at it Alone A defining feature of enterprise software is that it will affect an entire organization or business unit. Make sure you assemble a team internally to provide different perspectives for input and to assist in your negotiation strategy. Below is a reference table for perspectives and job functions that different levels of your company may provide: Best Practice 2: Prepare a Thorough RFP When considering new software, developing a Request for Proposal (RFP) is always recommended, even if upgrading a legacy system. In this step, your team will identify your needs and requirements, which in turn will help you better understand your priorities in the purchase. Take the time to: survey your team, identify all your requirements and to ask vendors how they meet those requirements. From there, your team will be well equipped to analyze vendor responses and to compare: functionality, implementation methodology and lead times, cost and the applicability of the software to your industry. Upon reviewing qualified proposals, vendors conduct software demonstrations to address: issues or concerns you may have, functionality gaps and how the vendor will overcome those gaps. A well designed and organized RFP process will help you focus your software vendor selection process and ensure you move forward with the best solution for your company. Best Practice 3: Understand your Fees and Hidden Costs It s highly likely that you will end up having to pay more than the price listed on a software company s website, and even initial proposals may not list every fee that could be coming your way. When negotiating with a software vendor, do the research to assess the total cost, considering several aspects: Additionally, understand the different pricing metrics companies use to determine how much you will be charged for their solution. Typically, the solution will fall under one of these models: Size-Based How big your company is Ex. Total revenue or total employee headcount Transaction-Based How often the solution is expected to be utilized Ex. The volume of order fulfillments or the number of pay periods Outcome-Based How much a solution is likely to achieve for a company Ex. Percent of cost savings or percent increase in qualified leads Best Practice 4: Don t Be Bullied with Terms Conditions Software companies are notorious for insisting on their own (self-serving) terms conditions when negotiating with new customers. To ensure your needs are met, it is best to prepare key areas where you may need to negotiate. Here are common points of contention with software companies to consider: Best Practices 5: Don t Box Yourself in to One Supplier Through the RFP process, you will come to a point where you narrow the potential vendors down to two finalists. It may be to your benefit to negotiate with both vendors until you have reached a deal. Different vendors will prioritize different negotiation points and be willing to concede on different items in a contract. By having options (and making both vendors aware of your options) you increase your leverage and ability to negotiate a favorable deal. If your team determines that requirements just cannot be met within the negotiating process, do not be afraid to walk away. If you do walk away from negotiations, meet with the team to: reframe expectations, strengthen negotiation tactics and to determine whether the next-best software option is a realistic candidate. Conclusion: Considering these five best practices and putting in the person-hours ahead of time will allow you to confidently source and negotiate your next enterprise-level software deal like a pro and make you a hero for your business. With a competitive marketplace and new solutions emerging every year, be strategic in your negotiating process. Leverage our IT sourcing experts for your next major software purchase.

    "text": "How can Blockchain Technology Transform Supply Chain Management? As supply chains continue to grow more complicated and complex, customers and regulators are seeking transparency up the chain. Blockchain technology is positioned to become the solution to provide this benefit, along with many others. Centered around the visibility and availability of specific data, blockchain technology can help supply chain leaders build and retain supply chain resiliency moving into the future. Transparency is the name of the game in the supply chain world. Customers are demanding honesty, openness, and accountability about where products are coming from, while companies are trying to manage complex supply chain systems, control costs, and minimize errors. Blockchain has emerged as a solution to untangle data, manage documents and contracts, and handle communication exchanges within the supply chain ecosystem. What is Blockchain? Blockchain is a cloud-based digital ledger and record of information, where transactions are recorded and distributed across networks of computer systems. Essentially it is a type of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), that acts as a decentralized database managed by multiple participants. It records items in a chain of secure blocks, which allows different partners to upload information at any time, and the blockchain saves retains all copies. This allows the blockchain to show real-time information and chronological changes to any item simply becoming a single point of all shared information. What are the Benefits of Blockchain? There are numerous benefits to blockchain including: Secure Transactions are logged in blocks and all of them are individually encrypted. Distributed Each participant can access and has a copy of the ledger as it works like a digital record that is accessible to a network of individuals. Programmable Gives you the capability to create and run applications, like smart contracts. Time-Stamped Every transaction recorded on a block is timestamped, paving the way for even more transparency. Immutable Blockchain technology was designed for robust security features, and validated records can no longer be altered or reversed. Blockchain Industry Applications: The powerful features of blockchain technology are now reaching many industries, some of which are known to have the most complex supply chains, regulatory actions, and need for transparency. Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Banking Finance, Food Farming, Tourism, Oil, Fashion, and Jewelry are just a few industries ripe for disruption with the application of blockchain technology. Food Supply Chain: In the food industry, partnerships can be made with the growers, suppliers, processors, distributors, and retailers to tie the whole supply chain together and to drive more efficient operations and tracking, end to end.. Increased transparency and efficiency in the food supply chain can help track and trace food epidemics and help save inventory, where now much or all of it is scrapped. Walmart, IMB, JD.com, and Tsinghua University have partnered to research and maintain the blockchain tech and manage the shipping and manufacturing processes. As this project progresses, other large corporations such as Nestle, Unilever and Tyson Foods are expected to participate in the joint venture. Other ventures have been able to use QR codes to stop illegal wine production by placing QR codes on bottles that allow shoppers to scan the code and receive all supply information about their purchase. These programs are just the beginning of what could become a very transparent way for customers to have all product information for any item at the click of a button. Diamonds and Jewels Supply Chain: The diamond industry has many problems, especially relating to the working conditions. In many cases, diamonds are mined under dangerous or inhumane conditions and can be used to finance many disputes in the main regions of mining, namely Africa. The world s largest diamond producer, De Beers, want to end this cycle with a blockchain supply chain program called Tracr. In this program, participants upload photos and information about the color, quality, and location of cut diamonds. The program aims to bring transparency to the diamond industry and help prevent illegal mining activities across the globe. Brilliant Earth, a jewelry company, is following this lead by using blockchain to track, trace the origin, and ensure legitimacy of their diamonds, gemstones, and precious metals. As customers become more aware of, and concerned about the origins of their purchases, companies that incorporate blockchain into their supply chains can create competitive advantage. Every indication is that blockchain is poised to be a game changer in supply chain. Early adopters of this technology are using it to: manage and track their assets, regulate and audit their supply, track sales, improve processes through smart contracts, accept cryptocurrency as payments, and boost their digital identity. Blockchain is still in its nascent form but is poised to revolutionize supply chain management. In the coming years, it is expected to expand at a rapid pace, but transformation takes time in such well-established industries and processes. With the addition of robotics, automation, and machine learning, blockchain can become the default technology in supply chains and unleash its true potential as a game changer in the industry.

    "text": "Sustainable Procurement: 4 Steps for Transforming Your Organization Why is Sustainable Procurement Important? For hundreds of years, most businesses operated with the primary goal of generating profit and value for shareholders. At times, however, this objective has been at odds with other goals, such as being good stewards of our communities and of our environment. Almost every day, there are news stories of a climate-driven drought causing wildfires or mass pollution of the ocean wreaking havoc on a critical ecosystem. For over a decade, the Business Roundtable CEOs, have been committed to modernizing the purpose of a corporation and demonstrating that environmental sustainability and economic growth in the U.S. can be achieved together. Their mandate is to challenge old rule that a business exists to maximize profit. The Roundtable came away in agreement that companies must also protect the environment by embracing sustainable practices. Now, it is Procurement s time to step up and to be the leader of change. Procurement is the control point in the organization to ensure third parties sustainably conduct business. In a recent trend, Chief Procurement Officers are taking on the responsibility of ensuring enterprise-wide sustainability efforts. The Basics of Procurement s Influence on Sustainability: First, let s define procurement Procurement s goal at the most basic level is to obtain third party goods or services at the most competitive price and the best quality needed for the everyday functioning of the business. Second, let s define sustainability Avoiding the depletion of natural resources to maintain an ecological balance. Now, let s bring it all together Sustainable Procurement evaluates the impact a purchase or third party partnership has: on the environment, socially and economically rather than solely focusing on price point and quality. Now more than ever, procurement professionals must re-examine their priorities in accordance with these three pillars: Understanding the basics will help professionals better evaluate everyday purchasing decisions. However, to have an impact enterprise-wide, organizations must develop a more detailed and holistic approach. Putting the Basics into Action: A 4-Phased Approach to Become a Sustainable Procurement Organization: Spend Analytics Analyze your trailing 12 months of spend and tier your supply base based on the value of spend, category of spend and transactional volume. Leverage the Pareto principle and focus on suppliers that compose the top 80 of total spend value. Helpful hint prioritize quick win categories at first that will drive a sustainable impact without substantial resource expense commitment. KPIs Best Practices Review best practices for implementing sustainable operations. Define key metrics to evaluate your supply base and create metrics that connect to corporate sustainability objectives. A few standard metrics to measure supplier performance are: annual carbon footprint, work travel emissions, number of deliveries, percentage of recyclable materials in products, usage of alternative energies and plastic packaging usage. Collaboration This is a critical component. Businesses must collaborate with their suppliers to improve operations. You will not accomplish your sustainability objectives without developing a partnership with your suppliers. Set up a meeting with your partner and align on measurable sustainability metrics. Develop a baseline for measurement. Develop an action plan to improve on agreed-upon metrics. Incorporate the metrics into supplier performance management programs for regularly cadenced reviews. Reference our blog for more information on supplier performance partnerships Supplier Performance Management Sourcing If a supplier cannot improve upon the metrics defined, it may be time to evaluate that relationship by conducting a sourcing event and introducing new suppliers that emphasize sustainability. By understanding the basics of Procurement s influence on sustainability and developing a 4-phased approach to strategically target suppliers based on analytics and metrics, your organization will see a clear improvement in both environmental impact and improved public image and likely increasing sales!

    "text": "Procurement Fraud: What is it, and How to Prevent it In today s fast-paced and increasingly complex corporate environment, procurement teams are trusted to make thousands of decisions that could significantly impact a company s financial health and reputation. Most procurement teams take this responsibility very seriously and execute their roles ethically and legally; however, with such responsibility comes an increased risk of fraudulent behavior. In this blog we will cover the main types of procurement fraud, how to identify it, and how to reduce the potential for procurement fraud in your organization. What is Procurement Fraud? Procurement fraud can take a variety of forms, from bid-rigging to supplier ethics. Here are some of the most common, and most damaging unethical procurement practices: How to Identify and Limit Procurement Fraud ProcureAbility advises companies to routinely review large areas of spend and conduct routine audits of procurement decisions. Protocols must also be established to trigger governance reviews in the event of routine direct awards, change orders, project overruns, and significant increases to supplier spend. ProcureAbility recommends the following three actions to help identify and limit procurement fraud: Create a Governance Committee: Establish a committee that includes key stakeholders from multiple organizational units (Finance, Supply Management, IT, etc.). This committee must develop policies and safeguards that help eliminate unethical and potentially illegal procurement behavior. Focus on Education: Conduct periodic instructor led or self-guided training to help procurement professionals and other internal stakeholders on your company s sourcing, ethics and compliance policies. Invest in Fraud Mitigation: Companies should invest in tools and technologies that enable employees to identify fraud. Employees must be challenged and incentivized to stay vigilant and to report any activity that does not adhere to all laws, regulations, and other legal requirements of the organization. US Federal Government Oversight In November 2019, the Department of Justice announced the formation of the Procurement Collusion Strike Force (PCSF). This coalition has since been tasked with deterring, detecting, investigating, and prosecuting antitrust crimes, including bid-rigging and other fraudulent activities that undermine competition on government procurement organizations. In June 2021, the PCSF secured its first international indictment involving a Belgian security services company that pled guilty for bid-rigging on contracts for the U.S. Department of Defense. The Belgian company and its co-conspirators were involved in a bid-rigging scheme in which they had agreed among themselves to determine which contractor would win a specific contract and who would decline to bid. This act resulted in a guilty plea, the resignation of multiple senior officers, and an astounding 15 million fine. Ethical procurement principles should be embraced and adopted by all companies. Placing an emphasis on education and detection can position procurement organizations to earn and maintain the trust of their stakeholders, suppliers, and regulatory agencies. Failure to comply with ethical standards could result in hefty fines and significant setbacks for a company s public image.

    "text": "M A Procurement: How to Maximize Post-Merger Savings Overview Most mergers and acquisitions (M A) and private equity (PE) deals fail to unlock the desired value in a defined target period due to varying reasons, including insufficient due-diligence, cultural differences, inefficient change management, lack of leadership engagement, technology limitations and misaligned synergy targets. Cost synergies, particularly those driven by third-party spend, are a key driver of M A activity and an important metric for determining transaction success. Procurement Organizations in Post-Merger Integrations The role of procurement organizations in a post-merger scenario is becoming increasingly important, with the ability to: Deliver short term (1-6 months) cost synergies to maximize savings, and thereby boost early shareholder confidence in the deal through: Quick Wins: Price alignment and contract, SLAs payment terms alignment. Strategic Sourcing: Volume leverage, supplier(s) spend consolidation, scope requirements alignment, should cost modeling, etc. Deliver desired long-term change (6-12 months) by optimizing sourcing processes and organization structure to drive sustainable value creation through: Procurement Transformation initiatives such as internal policy benchmarking revisions, make vs buy analysis, re-org. change management implementation, supply chain optimization integration, and supplier relationship performance management. Illustrated below are critical Pre-Close and Post-Close (Day 1-100 ) procurement-related milestones to be implemented and monitored as part of the overall integration timeline, which in most deals is project managed by the IMO (Integration Management Office). The 3-Phased Approach towards Procurement Synergy Realization 1. Synergies Identification Prioritization: Procurement synergies in integrations can come from different initiatives as described earlier through Quick Wins, Strategic Sourcing and Procurement Transformation. Possible synergy sources can include finding economies of scale, price alignments, volume discounts, negotiations, supplier base rationalization, organizational resource efficiencies, and integration of knowledge bases (spend management, category plans, sourcing strategies). a. Identification: Companies should follow a structured and data driven approach towards synergy identification and estimations. It is critical to develop an accurate synergy baseline to ensure targets are realized. b. Prioritization: One of the best methods for prioritization of procurement synergies is to map the initiatives in the financial impact vs success probability matrix. The quick wins are the synergy initiatives with the highest probability for success and the biggest financial impact. 2. Strategic Roadmap Planning Execution: A synergy implementation plan needs to be developed before Day-1, which aligns with the overall integration plan and timelines for the merger or acquisition. The plan needs to be validated and agreed upon by all relevant stakeholders to drive accountability for the synergy targets. Key elements of the plan for execution could include: a. Category Planning: Identify target categories depending upon similarities between Buyer and Seller. Plan for a phased approach of implementing tactical and strategic initiatives category wise, which can help deliver significant savings for the combined entity. b. Contract Rationalization: Review contracts to harmonize between the two companies and initiate discussions with suppliers as necessary to negotiate for the best pricing, terms, delivery, and services. c. Sourcing Activities: Based on the review of spend of both companies and savings targets identified for the merged company, strategically plan for the sourcing activities that will be executed by the teams (RFPs, available resources, timelines, and tools) d. Sourcing Process Improvements: Identify and implement any short-term and long-term business process improvements which can enable savings for the new company. A centralized control tower can also be established to ensure greater spend control, visibility, and accountability during execution. 3. Synergies Realization and Tracking: Post Day-1, measured savings should be tracked against the synergy targets. Plan and align well in advance on processes, tools, and cadence for tracking post-merger. Regular reporting of synergies will not only provide transparency on the savings, but also increase accountability for the stakeholders to meet the targets. It is important for the leaders of the firm, especially the Chief Procurement Officer (CPO), to be involved in the early due diligence process, and align on the Post Day-1 synergy implementation plan and timelines to meet the required goals. Through a well-executed synergy plan, the CPO and the procurement organization can help deliver the maximum deal value. Most procurement organizations, however, are not adequately staffed during an integration to deliver on promised savings.

    "text": "How Porter s Five Forces Can Help Achieve Procurement Innovation To succeed as a business, it is essential that you understand your industry s strengths, weaknesses, and the competitive forces that exist within it. Porter s Five Forces Analysis is a model developed to serve exactly this purpose and can apply to businesses at almost any scale. Through this innovative analysis, Porter helped to deliver a strategic reinvention of procurement that is currently utilized by the world s most ground-breaking companies. Utilizing the Five Forces Analysis allows a business to understand the levels of competition within their industry s environment based on 5 different factors. With this knowledge, the company can then develop an optimized business strategy to drive higher profitability. So, how do you put Porter s 5 Forces into practice? In one recent example, we worked with a large utility client to incorporate Porter s 5 Forces into their category planning process. We quickly helped them to assess the impact of each force and how it could impact their overall category plan and sourcing execution strategies. By using Porter as a guide, the client, coached by ProcureAbility s category strategy experts, was able to develop a fact-based strategy that can be adjusted as market conditions change. Porter s Five Forces include: Competitive Rivalry: Understanding the strength of your competition within an industry is an essential component to formulating a successful business strategy. Competitive rivalry is the most important factor in this analysis because it both impacts and is impacted by all the other forces. Factors to consider in a sourcing event: How many competitors does your business have? How much of a market share do you hold against your competitors? Can you leverage your company s position within your competitive environment to achieve higher profit margins? Power of Buyers: This force looks at what power the customer holds within the industry. The consumer market dictates the demand of your product or service, making it a significant factor of business profitability. Power of buyer s factors to consider in a sourcing event: How can buyer demand impact the prices of your product service? How many buyers do you have? (The fewer customers your business has, the greater power buyers hold) What level of importance do different customers have to your business? (Some customers may be more valuable than others, and therefore hold more power) Power of Suppliers: This force determines the amount of leverage that a supplier has on your business. Suppliers are key determinants in your businesses operating cost, and ability to provide a product service. Thus, this force can have a large impact on profitability. Power of supplier s factors to consider in a sourcing event: How essential is the supplier s product service to your business? Are there multiple suppliers that can provide the same product service? (The fewer suppliers there are, the more power they have) Can you leverage the number of potential suppliers for concessions? Threat of Substitutes: The purpose of this force is to examine how the product service your company is providing can be differentiated from similar products services that other companies provide within the same industry. If there are numerous substitutes to what your business is delivering to customers, then you will have less power in your industry and face increased competition. Threat of substitute s factors to consider in a sourcing event: How is your company s product service unique? How does the quality of your product service compare to substitutes? How does the price of your product service compare to substitutes? Threat of New Entrants: This force is used to measure the likelihood of new competitors entering your business industry and can provide valuable insight when forecasting and developing a business strategy. As a company you should always protect yourself against new entrants to prevent losing market share. Threat of new entrant s factors to consider in a sourcing event: How quickly is the market your business operates in growing? (Markets that are quickly developing will result in increased competition) How much initial capital would a company need to enter your market? How strictly is your industry regulated? (Defense vs. furniture) What level of customer brand loyalty exists in the in the industry? Any company that seeks success will research and analyze their competition to come up with a strategy that best positions themselves within their industry. Porter s Five Forces is a blueprint that allows a business to assess specific areas which have the largest impact on competition within a market. The use of Porter s model within procurement can range from reducing costs to minimizing risk to driving innovation and because every business cycle begins with procurement, this makes it the best place to start.

    "text": "Building Resilience: Three Ways Your Procurement Organization Can Protect Itself Against Inflation High inflation is here and eroding our purchasing power, so what can we do about it? According to the numbers released by the Labor Department for July 2021, the Consumer Price Index rose 5.4 compared to the previous year. Not only are those numbers in line with June s figure, but also match the largest jump since August 2008. Similarly, the Producer Price Index soared to 7.8 , making it the highest since its commencement in November 2010. This means higher prices for the general public, not just organizations. During times of significant inflation, a thorough examination of an organization s spend is crucial, and this is where procurement shines. For the past 30-40 years, we have experienced relatively stable inflation with few exceptions. Inflation is the general rise in prices, and while low levels of inflation are normal, significant inflation like we are experiencing is rare and requires strategic attention. The current period of inflation is primarily due to significantly increased overall demand as the economy returns to pre-pandemic levels, while supply struggles to return to pre-pandemic levels. This has resulted in higher prices, eroded purchasing power and a lower standard of living. We knew when we made a large purchase, we could count on paying relatively the same as the year before. But as of now, this is not the case. So, what can we do about? Times of inflation may seem daunting, but in fact they re an opportunity to reinforce cost management that can continue after inflation subsides. There are three key steps to achieving these improvements and ensuring the financial health of any organization. Promote Internal Alignment and Supplier Transparency In today s environment, many organizations are facing a disruption in their supply chain. Ensure alignment and transparency within Procurement, Finance, Operations, and Engineering by regularly communicating and aligning on a central strategy to balance supply and demand. Market intelligence and internal assessments are critical for anticipating price increases from suppliers. The messaging to all suppliers must be clear that cost management is a major priority. Two similar methods can be used to achieve this: Utilize deconstructed pricing: work with the supplier to breakdown and understand costs of each line item. This is a simple fact-based way to push back on price increases. Implement should-cost modeling: research the cost structure and drivers behind the categories you are procuring. If the supplier is proposing an overall 10 price increase but the cost base for that product or service has increased by 3 , there clearly is room for push back. Conduct Sourcing Events and Quick Bids Create as many alternatives as possible. This will set the stage for negotiations and best alternatives to a negotiated agreement (BATNAs) that will put pressure on incumbent suppliers to lower prices and can reveal better suppliers. Employ RFPs to your organization s advantage and create an environment of competitive bidding to compare prices. Substitute your procurement strategies with a lower-cost substitute. Although this may not be ideal, it might be what is needed to offset inflation in the short-term. Apply strategic sourcing for quick wins in categories that are not under inflationary pressure or have not had much attention. This is a great way to counteract price increases in other categories. Negotiate Favorable Contract Terms Decide which terms and conditions your organization can concede in exchange for price concessions. Again, this why internal communication and alignment are important. Consider longer term agreements and or increased purchasing volume. Other terms to consider include payment terms, insurance and intellectual property (IP). Examine implementing index-based pricing terms that allow for a price increase or decrease if an agreed-upon index moves more than 3 in either direction. Indices to consider should include the consumer price index (CPI), producer price index (PPI) and cost-of-living adjustment (COLA for services). Now more than ever, organizations need to focus on procurement by achieving internal alignment, conducting fact-based discussions with suppliers, competitively bidding and building favorable contract terms to avoid the damaging effects of inflation. Our team at ProcureAbility specializes in these practices and can reinforce cost management to reduce the effects of inflation on your organization.

In order to best support our clients during this new normal, we identified the factors of change that are most critical for organizations to understand to help shape their future success. Through extensive research and real-world implementation with clients, we found that In simple terms, companies that anticipate and plan effectively for business continuity can adapt much more rapidly to changes in geopolitical regulations, high volatility in demand, and economic uncertainty. A key factor in supply chain resiliency is being exactly that a resilient supplier. We know that conducting a sourcing event and awarding business to qualified supplier(s) is the first of many, critical steps for any successful Procurement organization. Supplier relationships that are not actively monitored can often lead to complacency, quality compliance issues, budget overruns, and overall poor performance. This, in turn, can lead to dissatisfied business stakeholders, customers and clients. For these reasons, it is imperative to have a well-defined Supplier Relationship and Performance Management framework.

    "text": "Does Procurement Need a Mission Statement? Most companies use mission and vision statements to guide their actions, decisions, and culture. However, mission statements can also be used within a company s functional teams and business units. These can give new purpose and identity to groups who may be undervalued or are seen as a bureaucratic necessity rather than a benefit. Procurement leaders, ask yourselves: do I need a mission statement? In procurement s case, realigning from reactive and transactional to strategic and intentional demands that a common vision is communicated and that strategic goals are aligned across the group. This is where the mission statement comes in. Mission statements can be highly useful for getting everyone on the team, as well as those it supports, rallied around the unified vision and goals. In any mission development process, it is critical to communicate and create buy-in within the affected group and with external stakeholders who may be impacted. Understanding how change impacts various groups such as finance, HR, operations, and IT is key in establishing alignment between procurement s mission and that of the business units and overall company. How can mission statements be made actionable and embedded in the team s mindset? Savings, diversity spend, and other quantitative factors will always be key measures on the procurement scorecard, but how about the qualitative factors? Those intangibles that are often overlooked but are often at the heart of a procurement team s mission? Answers to the following questions will assist in defining a procurement team s mission statement as well as identifying where improvements are needed: Does an organization go beyond purchasing and achieve successful collaboration with strategic partners? Is the team integrated enough into business decisions to identify opportunities that reduce demand or consolidate spend between business units to drive volume incentives? Are reductions in total cost of ownership captured due to the team s working knowledge of the company s operations? What does success look like and why? What are the indicators that will be evident once the organization has reached its goals? What new functions has the organization adopted in an ideal future state? What are the current challenges to overcome? Do we measure success by dollars saved, or social responsibility? Or something else altogether? Once a roadmap is established to address the gaps made evident by the previous questions, the end state objectives can be used to create the team s mission and vision which not only serve as a guide to the ideal state but also a source of inspiration and focus for when the team inevitably struggles to move forward. These concepts can be applied to procurement teams ranging from 2 to 200 employees. Regardless of the team size, a common understanding of team purpose and identity as articulated in a mission statement provides the motivation and focus needed to see the team through to achieving its objectives and continuing a path of growth. https: procureability.com does-procurement-need-a-mission-statement",

    "text": "Safeguarding your Post-Pandemic Supply Chain The COVID-19 pandemic affected the ability to procure a variety of necessary goods and services, creating shortages in everyday essentials from toilet paper to computer chips to skilled labor. These disruptions greatly tested the resiliency of our supply chains. With the country beginning to emerge from the pandemic, risks abound as we slowly return to pre-pandemic spending levels and adapt to a new normal. It is therefore becoming exceedingly important to be aware of the risks that face your supply chain upon COVID-19 re-opening. Implementing the six strategies below can help you safeguard your supply chain from these re-opening risks. 1. Diversify your supply base Value: High Complexity: Medium High Having an Approved Supplier List with stratification that is regularly evaluated and maintained is the first step to understanding your partners and where associated risks may lie. Vary the geography, size, and ownership type of your suppliers to bolster your network. Consider a competitive sourcing event for any sole-sourced commodities or services. Engage 3rd Party Risk Management as a stakeholder in your sourcing events to carefully screen any new partners. Finally, conduct a risk assessment of your supply base to get ahead of any risks your suppliers may face should their processes be disrupted. 2. Enhance supplier governance Value: High Complexity: Low Medium The most productive relationships are mutually beneficial. During contract negotiations, ensure all parties have a clear understanding of each other s goals and establish KPIs and or SLAs to measure progress against them. Conduct regular business reviews to track progress and to address gaps or concerns. These forums should also serve as opportunities to get ahead of potential bottlenecks or disruptions. 3. Rationalize every dollar Value: High Complexity: Low COVID-19 has greatly affected purchasing habits, so instead of using last year s budget as baseline, justify every dollar of spend by developing a should-cost model based on future demand with escalation considered to protect against volatility. Update the models regularly and keep a close eye on input pricing. This will allow you to understand adjusted demand levels before making price adjustments. Defining your new target is key prior to addressing price with a supplier. 4. Empower your talent Value: High Complexity: Low With the rising appeal of gig economy work, the onset of the Great Resignation, and a competitive hiring market, retaining talent is becoming increasingly difficult. Data shows resignations are at an all-time high and there are more opportunities available for job seekers. To help safeguard your workforce upon re-opening, assess gaps and identify opportunities to upskill reskill employees to fill gaps. Consider offering return incentives, including remote work, to allow greater flexibility. Finally, consider cross training your employees to bolster contingency plans and to recognize adaptable employees. 5. Obtain end-to-end data visibility Value: High Complexity: Medium High The volatility of consumer s rapidly changing purchasing needs during the re-opening increases the threat of greater imbalances between supply and demand. Order data visibility from your suppliers is key to avoiding delays, expedites, or canceled orders. Supplier data can be integrated into your ERP to provide information needed to manage inventory and to reduce supply chain risk. 6. Consider a technology assessment Value: Low Medium Complexity: High Robust technology is the backbone of a resilient supply chain. Considering the changing needs of your business may help identify gaps that new technology may be able to address. Software, such as lifecycle management tools and procure-to-pay systems, leverage workflow management to streamline tasks and to automate previously manual tasks, which frees up your team s capacity to focus on more strategic work. The 4-box graphic below shows the relationship between value and complexity for each of these initiatives. We recommend you consider first the initiatives that deliver the greatest value with the lowest complexity. Want to get started?

    "text": "Supplier Diversity: The Hidden Sales Weapon Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs) are for-profit small businesses where socially and economically disadvantaged individuals own at least a 51 interest, and also control management and daily business operations. Businesses owned and controlled by minorities or women are typically presumed to meet the socially and economically disadvantaged requirement. Common examples are: small-business enterprises (SBEs), minority-owned business enterprises (MBEs) and woman-owned business enterprises (WBEs). Since certification of DBEs are typically done at the local, state, or regional level, the requirements vary slightly from one region to the next, but the following criteria are widely used: At least 51 percent of the business must be owned and controlled by a socially and economically disadvantaged individual or individuals. The socially and economically disadvantaged owner must control the company s daily management and operations. The DBE must be an independent business whose viability does not depend on its relationships with other companies. The DBE must employ its own workforce and equipment necessary to perform its work. The DBE must meet its financial obligations. By incorporating a larger percentage of DBEs into your firm s sourcing activities, the active pool of vendors will naturally shift to include a higher concentration of these diverse businesses, and your firm s Tier 2 diverse spend will increase. This helps to drive competition between your company s existing and potential vendors, and to promote innovation through the introduction of new unconventional solutions. And there s something else, which can be far more important to CEOs: the correlation between high diverse spend and increased market share. According to a Hackett Group study, companies that allocate 20 or more of their spend to diverse suppliers attribute 10 -15 of their annual sales to supplier diversity programs. Conversely, companies that direct less than 20 of spend to diverse suppliers attribute under 5 of sales to their supplier diversity program. Furthermore, companies that increase their diverse spend have been proven to see an increase in market share relative to companies with below-average DBE spend. In other words, companies that spend more with diverse suppliers see a direct correlation to increased sales. Pretty cool, huh? From a social responsibility perspective, supplier diversity involvement directly improves the economy by promoting the growth of diverse businesses which often encounter barriers to their startup and to sustainability efforts, such as networking opportunities and access to capital. According to the Disparities in Capital Access report released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, it is estimated that half of all Hispanic families have less than 7,950 in wealth, and half of all African American families less than 5,446. Wealth levels among whites are 11 to 16 times higher. The report states: Low levels of wealth and liquidity constraints create a substantial barrier to entry for minority entrepreneurs because the owner s wealth cannot significantly be invested directly in the business, nor used as collateral to obtain business loans or to acquire other businesses. Additionally, demographic shifts create opportunities for diverse suppliers to meet the needs of evolving populations around the U.S. and the world. A recent U.S. Department of Commerce study has projected that this growing minority population will account for as much as 70 percent of the total increase in purchasing power from 2000 to 2045. Businesses that are ahead of the curve on incorporating DBEs into their supplier pool will have improved outreach to these growing populations compared to the businesses with low DBE engagement. Along with the many benefits that DBE s deliver to larger organizations, diverse vendors often provide unique perspectives that allow them to meet your business needs in a way that might not be considered by many of the lager, non-DBE companies. While the overall impact of increasing supplier diversity spend might not be immediately realized, the data shows that over time a robust supplier diversity program provides a true competitive advantage.

    "text": "Integration of Data Analytics with Procurement We all know analytics are important, but has it occurred to you that they are only becoming more valuable? Data allows companies to gain a better understanding of their business and it positions teams, like Procurement, to create innovative solutions to challenges that we face today and in the future. Procurement organizations can receive significant benefits by increasing their focus more on data analytics here are 3 examples: Obtain valuable market insights from the sourcing process. Supplier proposals can be a gold mine of market data such as labor rates, item pricing, volume discounts, contract exceptions, and past performance. These insights can be used to identify high quality suppliers, to benchmark future purchases, and to develop negotiation positions. Identify changing stakeholder requirements. Data analysis can be used to identify changing stakeholder requirements and to predict changes in their needs that may be impacted by the market s current supply and demand. Using data to create a predictive models gives Procurement teams the power to anticipate changes in stakeholder demand, thus reducing waste and better meeting their wants and needs. Get the best quality products at the best possible price. Leveraging data analytics is a key method for supply chains to obtain their ever-present goal of maximizing cost-efficiency. Procurement analytics experts have the power to continuously assess real-time pricing and product availability from potential suppliers (including quality information and transportation costs). Why is this important? As data modeling and analytics tools become more prevalent, Procurement will need a new set of skills to leverage these capabilities. Not everyone needs to be a data scientist, but Procurement will need to know how to: interpret data, develop action plans, and make decisions based on what they see in the data. By implementing some of the ideas we discussed above, Procurement teams can start embedding analytics as a standard part of their process your stakeholders and suppliers will thank you later!

    "text": "Intelligent Automation in Transportation Sourcing We re entering a time of transition from manual control of sourcing processes to machine-enabled sourcing. However, if you re involved in sourcing complex transportation or MRO categories, you know that most bid tools haven t been able to handle a process with hundreds of suppliers, thousands of lines or items, each with multiple bid components, without significant human expertise and intervention. But the pace of innovation is picking up speed. Procurement automation is taking swift and giant strides forward thanks to developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning even in the most complex transportation categories. With rising rates, tighter capacity, and a huge increase in demand due to the pandemic (see more here on our recent Webinar: Optimize Your Logistics), sophisticated shippers are adopting procurement technologies to optimize carrier relationships, capture cost savings, and reduce risk. Procurement tools with bid optimization capability first appeared in the early 2000 s and these tools have been informing decision making with detailed trade-off analyses of multiple scenarios with various criteria and constraints. Tools using AI and machine learning are emerging to address more complex procurement processes and further automate workflows. The combination of AI and automation, referred to as intelligent automation, describes a range of technology which reduces human input and improves over time: developing the capability to make decisions based on previously used data. Bid tools enjoy high adoption among Procurement organizations, but most of these tools offer no more than spreadsheet-like capabilities for complex categories. Often, companies turn to consultants with specialized skillsets and tools to support their team on a complex bid optimization event. Companies like Keelvar and Evos Logistics have developed procurement software tools that address even the largest and most complex transportation RFPs and are learning to address market volatility. Increased capabilities, leveraging AI and automation, offers these key benefits: Process Automation Computerized identification of opportunities triggers sourcing events, from simple spot bids to complex long-term contracts as needed, with little to no configuration. AI technology allows multiple bids to be conducted with scenario management. Shippers can now consider more factors varying routes, service levels, and modes to decide the optimal contract award combinations. Increased Visibility Supplier and rate data allows for increased transparency through the entire supply chain. The compilation of data, captured from multiple sources, for a single source of truth will increase spend visibility and provide insights into a company s supply chain. Automation eliminates manual data management and tracks all bids, leading to increased traceability and compliance with policy. Data Driven Decisions Leverage real-time data to validate freight rates to stay one step ahead of market trends and competitors. Intelligent automation offers the ability to digitize decision-making, which is a crucial step in making positive impacts in an organization. Additionally, available rate data can help quickly pinpoint risks to transform towards a more resilient supply chain. As always, companies must start with an assessment of your internal capabilities and clear goals for your department. For many companies, transportation sourcing has become the critical function for delivering to customers. The successful automation of sourcing strategies with alerts based on market conditions, tied to a robust sourcing technology, may soon be the competitive advantage that defines winners and losers in an unpredictable supply market. https: procureability.com intelligent-automation-in-transportation-sourcing",

    "text": "What Does the Global Chip Shortage Mean for You? Semiconductors, or computer chips, are the brains of modern electronics, enabling highly advanced technologies in healthcare, communications, computing, and transportation, among many other applications. There are 169 U.S. industries that use semiconductors in their products. What is happening? A global shortage of computer chips is having a ripple effect across many industries and analysts say the squeeze could last into 2022. The shortage began with automotive chips and is now impacting the supply of chips used for smartphones, laptops, washing machines, refrigerators, and other equipment. The issue highlights the disruptive effects of both the China-US tech war and the COVID-19 pandemic on a stretched global supply chain. How did this occur? The events leading to the current shortage began during the second quarter of 2020 and are multi-faceted. Major factors impacting computer chip availability include: 1) In response to pandemic reduced demand, automakers stopped buying so many chips, then when strong demand rebounded more quickly than expected, chip availability was constrained. 2) As auto industry orders dropped, semiconductor manufacturers switched production and order fulfillment to other, more profitable, business lines while at the same time, other pandemic-related products increased overall chip demand. 3) As a result of US sanctions, Chinese technology firms such as Huawei began suddenly boosting stockpiles of chips, which created a cycle the bigger the stockpile, the tighter the supply, encouraging more companies to expand chip inventory purchases. 4) On March 1, China waived levies on imported semiconductor parts and materials until 2030, increasing their chip imports to all-time highs. China expects a strong rebound economic opportunity as vaccinations counter the global health risk and wants to ensure plentiful chip supply for domestic manufacturing. 5) Production is concentrated in Asia, primarily China, and it can take foundries a year or more to bring new capacity online. Making a semiconductor is one of the most complex manufacturing processes with lead times of up to 26 weeks to produce a finished chip. What is the impact? While price increases because of the chip shortage remain confined to the semiconductor sector for now; analysts say some products may see price pressure soon, in addition to shortages of finished goods. Change is also quickly coming to long-held practices such as just-in-time inventory, whereby minimum stocks are held based on the assumption that supplies are always secure and efficient. How will this affect supply chain operations? One of the main challenges now is that chip production cannot be easily ramped up, so it looks like this shortage will need active management through 2022. Though price increases are to be expected, that s not the main issue. As we ve seen in other crunches, the problem here isn t how much it costs, it s availability. Production lag times and delivery schedules are expected to increase as manufacturers across sectors adapt to the loss of these key inputs. This crisis is spreading across industries as manufacturers respond, react, switch, scramble, and over-order, all of which could impact equipment purchases. Here are some ideas as to how to prepare: Move now to identify chip-dependent products within your portfolio and monitor availability status. Increase order size to provide more inventory cushion and better prepare for delivery lag times. Examine maintenance and diagnostic protocols to stretch out replacement schedules. Review end of life disposal practices and consider retaining some equipment for short term bone-yard replacement availability. Work with OEM suppliers to see what type of chips are being used in what products. This could offer insight as to where the tightness is building and possibly allow you to be a half-step ahead. What s next? President Biden signed an executive order in February to address the global chip shortage. The order includes a 100-day review of key products including semiconductors and advanced batteries used in electric vehicles, followed by a broader, long-term review of six sectors of the economy. In April, President Biden, joined by top foreign and domestic policy advisers, met virtually with 19 Technology and Manufacturing CEOs to deal with the critical supply crunch. As was seen during all of 2020, supply chain organizations are at the forefront in responding to even the most unique challenges and have earned new respect throughout the corporate and community environments. Supply chain and procurement teams routinely manage detailed coordination of complex purchasing and delivery operations involving many people, facilities, and supplies. With severe weather and other unexpected events becoming more commonplace, supply chain and procurement teams have a unique opportunity to build on those successes, leverage logistical experience, and lead their organizations to a new level of preparedness. https: procureability.com what-does-the-global-chip-shortage-mean-for-you",

    "text": "Improve Your Procurement Data in Three Steps In today s world of Big Data, many procurement organizations struggle to incorporate data into their decision-making. The success of a well-defined procurement strategy may be undermined by a lack of data, or a lack of the right data, presented in a way that supports strategic planning and decision-making. Most organizations collect data on some level but fail to recognize the data as a valuable asset. A robust collection effort in a data-driven culture could reveal cost-savings insights, drivers to purchasing decisions, and assist in supplier risk management. Ultimately, the collection effort could direct the success of an organization s procurement strategy. The good news is there are specific steps you can take to improve the quality and usefulness of your data. Three principles of data collection that drive successful strategies are: Standardization: Common processes and categorizations across multiples sources Accessibility: The ease with which data can be viewed, manipulated and analyzed Necessity: Choosing data that is relevant to the analysis needed Standardization One would not compare apples to oranges Standard processes ensure the integrity and quality of the data. Data collection methodologies should be clearly defined across the entire organization. Classifications such as category codes and taxonomies should also be clearly defined for the organization. A common defined taxonomy also allows the reuse of data and eliminates redundancy for analysis. Standard processes and categorizations allow consistency among multiple data sources, encourage data sharing and ultimately help deliver more accurate insights. Accessibility A database where data is readily accessible and digestible encourages a culture where the information collected drives decisions and changes. A central and transparent repository enables decision-makers to focus on the critical data to quickly make better decisions and to implement change. Companies can begin to foster a data-driven culture by providing access to, and training for analytics tools; thus empowering employees with a basic knowledge of data manipulation and analysis. Central storage serving multiple business units will make it easier for stakeholders to find the right information. Access controls can also be implemented to limit access, if needed, for sensitive data. Organizations can benefit from a culture of analytic literacy and data-driven decision making that results from accessibility. Necessity Choosing the right data will ensure that investment and resources will be used efficiently to drive the procurement strategy. The investment in data collection is of little value if the data is not used as intended. The assumption that more data more information is common across organizations. A clear understanding of the organization s goals will provide an idea of what data is necessary. Companies should also prepare to be flexible in the data collected to meet the changing objectives of a procurement strategy. For example, given the number of standard procurement metrics, most companies will choose to track a few key performance indicators (KPIs) that are relevant to their business and to provide the insights that are most aligned to their strategic objectives. As those objectives change, the metrics (and underlying data) may need to change as well. Application of these principles to a data collection plan can help drive the success of your procurement strategy while building a data-driven culture. https: procureability.com improve-your-procurement-data-in-three-steps",

    "text": "Procurement Organizations Embracing Digital Transformation Global organizations across industries are embracing digital transformation to enable remote work environments and reduce operating costs through improved efficiency. Specifically, implementing procurement software is a common approach to streamlining source to pay operations and allowing personnel to shift their focus to strategic activities rather than manual, tactical tasks. What is Digital Procurement? Digital procurement tools (which were originally called e-procurement) typically take one of two forms: full suite and best of breed. Full suite solutions that serve the entire source to pay process have been around for decades and have become increasingly popular as companies better understand the related ROI and soft benefits. In its simplest form, digital procurement is the process of buying goods and services electronically in a business-to-business environment. Digital procurement solutions replace antiquated e-mail and paper driven processes from upstream (i.e., sourcing) to downstream (i.e., supplier payments) and everything in between. Most modern digital solutions are cloud-based and allow personnel to perform the following source to pay activities: Run sourcing events Onboard and manage supplier information Manage contracts Process and approve requisitions Manager purchase orders Process supplier invoices Review reports and analytics These are common modules that organizations choose to enable when implementing a digital procurement suite. However, most providers have an a-la carte system where organizations can customize their purchase to only select the modules they need. For example, if an organization needs to process requisitions, manage purchase orders, and process supplier invoices, they can purchase the appropriate Procure to Pay modules and choose not to bring on sourcing or contract management modules. There are many benefits to digitizing your procurement process. A few of these are: Process automation reduces transactional cycle times (e.g., invoice to pay) Cost savings through built in monitoring tools that help control costs and reduce overhead Standardized purchasing through preferred contracts Enhanced end-user experiences via interactive guided buying Increased spend visibility through centralized information; available to all levels of the organization Simplified roles and responsibilities A reduction in tactical work, which can increase focus and free up time for more strategic activities Implementation Approach: Digital procurement systems come with great tangible benefits, but organizations cannot simply flip a switch to turn on the technology. Typically, organizations go through an assessment of current processes and operations, select the technology that best fits their needs then design and implement the tools around future state needs. Often companies force technology enablement without considering the full procurement ecosystem, including the organization and processes, and wind up with a suboptimized toolset. Below are some of the most important aspects to consider when implementing digital procurement tools: Current technology landscape that may affect integration requirements Centralized vs. de-centralized operations affecting future state design Number of active suppliers that would need to be on-boarded to the new system Process transformation required to enable new technology How you will drive system adoption to increase usage of the new tools Scope of spend (categories, dollars, transaction volumes, etc.) that would be processed through the system, which can affect integration requirements and in-house training Overall, digital procurement solutions have allowed organizations to reduce operating costs, increase spend visibility, and transform procurement departments from tactical to strategic. By approaching the implementation with your organization and processes in mind (and adjusting as needed), you are much more likely to reap the benefits of your technology investment. https: procureability.com procurement-organizations-embracing-digital-transformation",

    "text": "Preparing for the next Power Outage with Emergency Generators and How Procurement Can Help Power outages affect millions of people across the US every year. Major recent events that resulted in outages include winter storms in Texas, hurricanes across the South and Eastern US, and wildfires in the West. Outages and power shutdowns can impact all industries and cause production losses, inventory deterioration, loss in sales, damage to critical equipment, and decreased employee productivity. While these impacts may be obvious to most, it is less obvious that Procurement can play a key role in mitigating the effects by implementing an emergency generator procurement strategy. Businesses can either choose to buy or rent a generator based on their specific requirements and capabilities. Factors such as costs, maintenance, and project timelines determine whether a company should buy or rent an emergency generator. Why should Procurement teams prefer renting an emergency generator? Although detailed cost-benefit analysis should decide the rent vs. buy decision, there are advantages for businesses to prefer renting over buying: Cost-Effective: Cheaper if the requirement is for short periods (ex: seasonal power outages) Space optimization: No permanent structure or space required Reduced maintenance costs: Most rental companies include service and maintenance in the rental fees Flexibility: Renting allows flexibility of sizing generators based on changing needs How can Procurement teams add value while sourcing emergency generators? Effective Planning An effective procurement plan increases the efficiency of the procurement process by describing: the detailed procurement schedule, the type of contract, the product demand (specific type and sizes of generators required), implementation milestones along with important deadlines, associated risks, and vendor evaluation metrics all of which are extremely critical when sourcing emergency generators. As the annual capacity necessary would be forecasted by the line of business operations teams, early alignment of procurement goals with the technical business requirements is important to achieve defined cost and timeline targets. Sourcing should: Be cognizant of supply constraints especially during peak seasons for wildfires, winter storms, or hurricanes. As supply may be limited during outage, plan early and lock in contracts with rental companies. Understand detailed technical requirements such as generator size, space, voltage, fuel, emissions, ancillary equipment, cabling, location, etc. Release RFI s early to gather information and conduct on-site feasibility studies, if required. Comprehensive Market Research Procurement should prepare a detailed analysis of the emergency generator supply market describing the multiple characteristics of the market using frameworks as applicable. The supply market analysis helps to identify supply trends, and to understand the risks associated with procuring temporary generators. Analysis could include regional and local power rental market shares, seasonality, and cost trends by fuel type (Diesel, Natural Gas, Battery etc.), competitive landscape, vendor analysis and inventory availability. Procurement should also consider the following key aspects during market research: Reliability and safety are critical to power generation. Conduct studies to recognize and pin-down the most reliable power rental suppliers in the market. Suppliers could be regional (city or state-specific) or multinational, depending on size, quality, technology, cost, and services. Understand influence of local regulatory bodies and laws (for example different states may have various emissions requirements governing commercial generators), and discuss the impact with legal teams, if required. Gather knowledge of advancements in generator technology, like clean energy alternatives to diesel (solar trailers, battery storage, and natural gas). The supply market is volatile due to the unpredictable nature of outages. Assess competition and bargaining power to mitigate cost increases during specific seasons of extreme weather. Total Cost of Renting Rental cost of the generator itself is just a portion of the total cost ( 30-40 depending on size of generator), whereas other fixed, variable, and service costs make up the rest. Fixed costs also include cables and ancillary equipment (transformers, load banks, trailers, switchgear, and fuel tanks) required to run the generator. Procurement must consider all pricing elements in a detailed cost breakdown should-cost analysis to help determine the total financial impact in various outage scenarios. Some recommended areas of focus while evaluating the total cost are: During negotiations with vendors, Procurement should discuss not only the total fixed costs but also variable elements such as labor rates for servicing, costs mark-ups for fuel (diesel or natural gas), one-time costs for mobilization demobilization of generators, and round-trip trucking to and from the location, all of which can affect the overall cost. Although multi-year contracts would increase the total rental cost (especially if requirement is only seasonal), some vendors may offer significant discounts for multi-year rental agreements; therefore, a detailed cost benefit analysis should be conducted to assess total savings. In the ever-changing world of temporary power generation, with a dynamic supply market and volatile emergency power demand, Procurement plays crucial roles; not only to ensure business continuity, but to improve profitability by reducing bottom line impacts during power outage events.

    "text": "Logistics Strategies: Fleet Procurement Fleet is an area where there are often significant cost saving opportunities. Fleets support critical business functions and may be the primary means of: delivering to customers, transporting employees and materials, and of ensuring the safety and function of core business operations. Procurement plays an interesting and critical role with fleet management and logistics strategies. The strategies outlined below can help your team manage budget constraints, increase visibility of spend, improve efficiency, and improve performance in maintenance operations. While there are various aspects of Fleet that should be considered when developing the strategy, we will focus here on acquisition and maintenance. The acquisition aspect of Fleet is at the core of a sound transportation strategy. Organizations may choose to lease, buy or take a hybrid approach when building out their fleet. Strategies vary widely based on industry, size of the organization, and purpose of the fleet. First, conduct an assessment that clearly outlines the purpose of the fleet, financial goals, risks, stakeholders, etc. With a fact-based assessment in hand, you can be confident in establishing your Fleet strategy. The assessment should address: Specifications: Specifications of the units should align to the overall purpose of the fleet. Determine if there are low cost or fuel-efficient options that will still serve the purpose. Be very clear on must haves vs nice to haves. When establishing specs, consider the total cost of ownership (TCO) over the lifetime of a unit, including maintenance and replacement costs. Options offered to the field should be minimized for streamlined management. Purchasing: If owned equipment fits your overall strategy, periodic strategic sourcing events can maximize your spend leverage (that is, lower costs) and provide an opportunity to improve warranties and service guarantees at the same time. It is important to negotiate the entire purchase for the upcoming 1-5 years in the strategic sourcing event. After the sourcing event is complete, ongoing orders can be placed against the pre-negotiated agreement with your established providers. Include warranties and service guarantees in your negotiations. Leasing: If leasing, it is important to determine if units in the fleet are a capital lease or operating lease. A capital lease is treated like an asset on the balance sheet and depreciates over time; whereas an operating lease is an expense, is not included on the balance sheet, and is used for short-term arrangements (similar to renting). Strategic sourcing is also appropriate for lease agreements. Events should leverage your total fleet spend. Full-service leases should be evaluated based on your internal maintenance capabilities and service profile. Replacement schedule: The depreciation schedule determines how the fleet s per unit value goes down over time. A thorough analysis of maintenance vs replacement costs can help you determine the exact timing to replace older vehicles and minimize overall costs. Ongoing awareness of the used vehicle markets is fundamental to this strategy. In 2020, savvy fleet managers who paid close attention to new vs used vehicle markets, were able to upgrade fleets for little cost when the price for used vehicles shot up much more than the increase in price for new vehicles. Maintenance is another critical aspect of your Fleet strategy. If units in the fleet continually break down and fail, the overall utilization will suffer and inevitably negate any cost savings. There are a few items to consider when evaluating fleet maintenance: Parts sourcing: Strategically sourcing parts may seem like a daunting task, but the rewards are significant. A thorough parts strategy will take into account the needs of your end users, mechanics and clerks. Providing a robust set of data and requirements to suppliers will support productive negotiations. Most suppliers in this space are accustomed to providing their customers with detailed purchase data; if your internal data doesn t give you the level of detail you require, then ask your incumbent suppliers to help. Maintenance providers: Good service provider relationships are based on good communication and providing visibility of your needs. Location, capacity, and service levels are just a few of the areas to explore when finding the right fit for your fleet. Maintenance plan: As a minimum, determine whether the current maintenance plan meets the manufacturer recommendations. Experience and research can help to identify the optimal maintenance plan for your fleet. Active management of warranties can generate millions of dollars in annual savings for a sizeable fleet. Maintenance costs: Tracking maintenance costs and understanding the trends as vehicles age is an important input to the procurement replacement schedule. Driver compliance: To ensure that drivers are complying with the established maintenance policies, you will need a tracking mechanism for your fleet. Telematics, the use of technology to control and monitor vehicles, is a growing method for preventative maintenance that reduces breakdowns and costly repairs. Fleet acquisition and maintenance sourcing strategies not only play a role in the utilization of the fleet, but the productivity of the operations as a whole. For example, if Hi-Los are required to move raw material around a manufacturing facility, unplanned downtime can lead to a reduction in overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) and ultimately production. Taking the time to develop a sound fleet sourcing strategy will pay dividends directly, create value, help avoid unnecessary costs, and boost the productivity of your fleet and operations. Do you have a solid fleet strategy in place?

    "text": "Severe Winter Storm Impacts Us All What happened in February? In February, an unprecedented winter storm covering most of the U.S. shut down many electric generation resources. Power blackouts occurred and the electric supply was drastically reduced at the same time as winter demand hit record levels. This necessitated rotational load shedding as a last-resort measure to avoid a total blackout of the power grid. What has happened since then? Operationally, all sectors of the power industry have examined the events and their response to them to determine lessons learned and ways to extend the resilience of the grid. Quickly, a new focus has developed on winterizing equipment and preparing for all types of severe weather conditions. This emphasis is extending across most utility operational areas, including generation, transmission distribution, and customer services. Specific to infrastructure services, such as design, engineering, and construction, new project specs are being developed to incorporate redundancy and resilience measures. On the regulatory front, several federal and state entities are reviewing the bulk-power system s operations during this extreme weather event. Changes in regulations across the spectrum are expected to result. Power costs skyrocketed on the Texas wholesale market when the power plants went offline, this substantially reduced energy supplies. As a result, the financial hit rippled through the sector, from insolvent power co-ops to electric retailers to consumers, all of whom are now faced with astronomical bills. An avalanche of litigation has been filed across the country including several class action lawsuits against all entities within the sector, including utilities. Several jurisdictions have sought criminal indictments against officials involved. How will this affect the utility industry and supply chain operations? The events of February are much wider spread than first thought and have the potential to shape utility policy, regulation, operation, governance and investment literally all aspects of the utility spectrum. Consider these observations: The grid failure was a risk management issue. Understanding and containing multi-dimensional risk, such as material supply risk, outage management, emergency response and customer service interactions will be key to protecting and preparing utility operations. Supplier competency and resilience measures are key supply chain contributions. Disaster planning scenarios that stress-test all phases of operations are a key component. Proper levels of supplies, prior to, and during a crisis often make the difference between good and bad outcomes. This includes typical grid repair equipment like transformers, wire, and fuses but also PPE like warm winter gloves, hand warmers and windbreaks as well as bottled water and rations. Supply chains must be at the forefront of disaster planning to properly prepare and support operations in quickly unfolding situations. Utility operations are a large system, and system testing teams (IT and other components) must be heavily incorporated into planning scenarios. Mission critical technology, such as distribution management Systems or supervisory control and data acquisition systems, should be included in cascading failure drills. The Supply Chain should be represented on these testing teams, and response planning should consider second-degree validations of conditions. Regulatory impacts may result from investigations across several jurisdictions. The importance of a fully functioning, risk-measuring supply chain was elevated in 2020 and reinforced recently during the grid failure. Procurement teams must monitor the regulatory proceedings to anticipate the infrastructural areas of greatest impact and to prepare for additional grid hardening, operational expansions and construction projects that could be widespread. These extensive construction projects could result in significantly constrained supplier sectors. Start now to assemble Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractors, expand stock levels, review warehouse and storage locations as well as logistics and freighting measures. What s next? The issues around the February 2021 failures are complex, and investigators will most certainly have a lot to untangle. This is an area that will need close monitoring nationwide as this unfolds, there is potential for materially changed utility operations. The key moving forward will be recognizing risks across a wide spectrum and developing integrated mitigation measures to address them; especially with extreme weather events that seem to be occurring more frequently. As was seen during all of 2020, Supply Chain is at the forefront in responding to challenges of all kinds and has earned new respect throughout the corporate and community environments. Procurement teams routinely provide detailed coordination of complex purchasing and delivery operations involving many people, facilities, and supplies. With severe weather and other unexpected events becoming more commonplace, Supply Chain and Procurement have a unique opportunity to build on those successes and leverage their logistical experience to lead their organizations to a new level of preparedness. https: procureability.com severe-winter-storm-impacts-us-all",

    "text": "RFP Award Scenarios While budget is generally an important component for decision making, it should not always be the top factor in awarding an RFP. After pricing has been received for an RFP, it is important to take a holistic view of the bidders capabilities using award scenarios. First, when setting up an RFP, create a scorecard with all the factors to consider when deciding the awards. (Pro tip: add a weight each of the items in the scorecard to make tracking easy). While pricing can be one factor in the scorecard, some other examples of criteria to include are: Quality Sustainability Corporate Social Responsibility Terms and Conditions Schedule Speed of Delivery Warranty Total Cost of Ownership Diversity Status With an established scorecard, grading an RFP is straightforward with formulas applying helpful outputs. Examples of award scenarios include: Lowest Price Under this scenario, the RFP would be award to the company with the lowest price, without taking other factors, like speed of delivery, etc. into consideration. This method is ideal when procuring IT hardware or other commodities that are easily standardized and can be bought from lots of suppliers in bulk. Highest Score This scenario awards the bid to the highest score on the scorecard, as described above. This approach can be beneficial for complex categories such as construction or engineering services where many factors are involved. Single Award In many situations, awarding to only one supplier will simplify the contracting process and minimize the administrative cost of managing multiple suppliers. In these cases, let suppliers know in advance that only one award will be made so they come with their best proposal. Multiple Awards In some areas, like construction services and critical parts, it is beneficial to award to multiple bidders to mitigate the risk of having only one source of supply. Ask yourself (and your stakeholders) if the awarded bidder can fulfill the contract by themselves and if the impact from delays supply disruption would require that you find another source. As with a single award scenario, suppliers will appreciate knowing in advance if you plan to make multiple awards. After reviewing the scorecard, consider the possible scenarios and make a pros and cons list for each. It is important to assess multiple scenarios before you award a contract through an RFP. 5 steps to reviewing an RFP: Identify what is important to the success of the project Establish weights for each component Grade RFP responses with a pre-built scorecard Consider all award scenarios Make a Pros Cons list Following these 5 steps will help ensure your company receives the best outcome from the RFP process and that the process does not drain unnecessary time from your organization. https: procureability.com rfp-award-scenarios",

    "text": "Applying Procurement Fundamentals to Everyday Life As procurement professionals, our job is to ensure clients consistently receive a quality good or service on-time, and at the best price. ProcureAbility begins each client engagement with knowledge accrued over decades of industry experience and couples that with extensive market research to ensure we can instantly add value to our clients. While we are always seeking new, innovative ways of doing our work, there are some old school procurement fundamentals that you can apply to everyday life to get the best value out of each purchase. Do Your Homework: Researching the marketplace is a critical first step to start any procurement improvement effort. Consider: Health of the Industry Market Intelligence: What is consumer demand for the specific industry? Benefit: Understanding consumer demand will help you determine your potential leverage during vendor negotiations (e.g., if the market is struggling, vendors will be even hungrier to earn your business) Interest Rates Market Intelligence: For large purchases, how are financing rates relative to past years? What is the interest rate breakpoint for when paying cash becomes more cost effective? Benefit: Understanding loan interest rates will help you determine if now is the appropriate time to make your purchase. It will also help you understand the feasibility should you be given a discount to pay cash. Manufacturer Performance Market Intelligence: Are there specific vendors or products that have had historical performance issues? What have vendors done in the past to rectify these issues? Benefit: Historical performance could serve as a pre-qualifier to immediately exclude certain vendors from your evaluation as maintenance costs can be a significant, unexpected and ongoing expense. Make Others Compete for Your Business: Requesting bids from multiple vendors is critical to ensure the best price and a comprehensive understanding of the marketplace offerings. For example, perhaps vendors are willing to include something additional at no charge or are willing to offer lucrative incentives should a large down payment be made? Request that quotes are itemized across each line item inclusive of those items that are offered for free (e.g., what is the standard price of this good or service if not offered for free?). This level of detail will facilitate a smoother evaluation as you will be able to better conduct an apples-to-apples comparison across vendor proposals. Negotiate, Negotiate, Negotiate: Negotiations are a critical step to ensure you are maximizing the value you can create. Below are a few considerations to keep in mind as you engage in your own personal procurements. Use Timing to Your Advantage: Timing your purchase to the end of a month or the end of a quarter could prove advantageous as sales representatives are trying to meet sales quotas. Vendors may be more willing to dig deeper into margins to hit their quota than they would be at the beginning of this cycle. Timing your purchase to after a new product line is announced could also prove advantageous as vendors are looking to move inventory at a discount in favor of the latest and greatest model. Let Other Party Offer First Avoid preemptively establishing a price floor by proposing your maximum price. Alternatively, provide directional feedback leaning on the market research you conducted earlier (e.g., This offer is not competitive compared to what I am seeing in the marketplace. ) Request that the vendor provide a fact-based rationale as to why they are requesting their price point. Silence Is Power Resist the urge to fill awkward silence as parties routinely talk themselves into offering additional concessions. A best practice is to state your ask and allow the counterparty to respond without interruption. If the negotiation is conducted in person, body language can be used to your advantage as subtle signs of displeasure such as crossed arms or pursed lips can lead the vendor to offering further concessions. Read the Fine Print After agreeing to a price point, always allot time to review the terms and conditions of the agreement. A few points to highlight include: Taxes and Fees: The final price point agreed to should be all inclusive without any gotcha payments being required to take delivery. Warranty: Should the product fail after you take delivery, what are your rights to ensure the vendor rectifies the situation? How long will the vendor offer these services? Interest Rates: Are interest rates stable across the life of the loan or are they adjustable based on the market? What could start as a great price point could quickly become unaffordable should interest rates increase after the purchase. Incorporating these tips and tricks into your everyday purchases will have you quickly operating like a procurement professional and ensure that you too are able to buy your goods and services at the right time, in the right quality and at the best price. Good luck! https: procureability.com applying-procurement-fundamentals-to-everyday-life",

    "text": "Enhancing Procurement Performance Assessments with Incentive Tracking and Supply Chain Data For your procurement organization, historical spend data may be the basis for measuring results, but there are limits to the extent procurement can be benchmarked by historical spend. In this blog we ll discuss some ways to supplement historical transactional data with data from other sources to provide a more complete picture of procurement performance. Tracking Payout Incentives If you are working with suppliers who have end-of-year volume or loyalty cash incentives, gaining visibility into the spend that generates the incentives can be a challenge. For example: A procurement organization negotiates a loyalty discount with an OEM whose franchise locations are supplying goods for purchase. Though purchase activity goes through the franchise location s point of sale and your procurement organization s ERP, certain financial incentives and payouts are tracked elsewhere and may or may not be centrally tracked. In some cases, OEMs and big suppliers are even outsourcing the tracking of the activity that generates the payouts or discounts. Even with visibility into the transactions generating the discount or payout, information is sometimes lost when communicating savings to the finance team. There may be no direct way to link financial incentives to purchase activity in real time, but at a higher level, these incentives should be reflected along your historical data, with average cost and last price paid information. Tracking Supply Chain Challenges to Show Procurement Wins In addition to the positive example of winning incentives, there are also positive ways to incorporate data from your supply chain. For example: A procurement organization is trying to move to suppliers with more onshore manufacturing capability due to uncertainties in their supply chain and because the incumbent supplier intends share any increased logistics costs due to fees or tariffs. If logistics costs suddenly increase 15 for your supplier, your procurement organization s performance can be assessed on the ability to rapidly adapt to new trade laws, to negotiate sharing the increased costs, and or to reduce disruptions in the supply chain. In the two scenarios above, the procurement organization s performance and contribution may not be visible in the raw numbers shown to the finance organization or to the CPO. In the first scenario, the process of working toward a consolidated set of spend analytics across organizations will help procurement tell its success stories more effectively. In the second, being able to show the impact of the changing supply market through external data will help to contextualize your increases in spend. Where you can negotiate cost sharing with suppliers the burden of the increased costs of logistics, the procurement organization s performance should be weighted alongside data about these market factors. A procurement organization s information capture should go beyond the data inside their ERP and their spend dashboards. The ability to capture additional data and present it alongside spend metrics is vital for showing successes that are being ignored or that happen during negative supply chain conditions. https: procureability.com enhancing-procurement-performance-metrics-with-incentive-tracking-and-supply-chain-data",

    "text": "Supplier Performance Partnerships Procurement Professionals know that their work does not stop once a supplier contract is signed. Supplier relationships grow and evolve over time, creating benefits and responsibilities for both sides. Supplier relationships do not grow on their own they need some input and participation from your organization in order to reach their full potential. That is where strong Supplier Performance Management practices come into play. This blog will cover the Supplier Performance Reporting Process and the 3 types of supplier relationships that your procurement organization may have. Supplier Performance Reporting Process Supplier performance reporting is a two-way communication cycle that highlights notable developments and opportunities or deficiencies within the supplier partnership related to cost, quality, or service. The cycle relies on timely communication, quantifiable key performance indicators (KPIs), win-win incentives and can be broken into 3 phases: Data Gathering Phase During this phase, the organization gathers data and assesses the suppliers performance. The data gathered should be as objective as possible and should track with the KPI s and goals set out in the contract. Supplier Performance Report Once the data is gathered, it will be consolidated into a report that tells the story behind the numbers. This report can be simple and targeted, such as a one-page summary of key items, or a robust dashboard with customizable filters and data visualizations. The important thing is for this report to be compiled on a set cadence, and for it to be consistently formatted for easy comparison. Revision and Correction Phase The supplier should have access to the supplier performance report from Phase 2. This provides them an opportunity to know where their strengths and deficiencies are. This also allows them an opportunity to correct anything that needs to be corrected within the report. Perhaps the data source you were using to compile the report was missing information from one key region or business unit and this phase allows for those mistakes to be caught and corrected. Above all, it s crucial for this process to be simple, repeatable, and easy to understand. An Example of the Supplier Performance Reporting Process Let s say that procurement manages the relationship with a key LTL Freight Supplier. This LTL supplier will handle the majority of ground transportation for at least the next two years. Timely and reliable delivery is key. The main metric, or KPI, that the organization uses is On-Time Performance (OTP), or the percentage of packages that arrive on time to their destination. The contract stipulates that the freight supplier must meet an average quarterly 95 On-Time Performance. Data Gathering Phase: The procurement organization will pull data from their Transportation Management Service (TMS) on a weekly cadence. Thankfully, this process has been automated with a SQL Script and so it s a one click process to pull this performance data. Occasionally, the organization will stress test and double check the data to make sure there aren t omissions or other errors. Supplier Performance Report: The organization uses the data to build the performance report. The performance data for the week is added to a simple BI dashboard with a couple of graphs that show the performance for the supplier by week and by region. Whenever the metric falls below the agreed to 95 , the graph flashes red. Revision and Correction Phase: The supplier has real time access to the BI Dashboard from Phase 2. They have 30 days after data upload to ask questions about specific weeks. Having access to this data has really motivated the supplier to stay above the 95 goal and has led to a noticeable improvement in their performance. Types of Supplier Relationships Not every supplier relationship will require the same level of partnership as the example above. Some will require a more hands-off approach. Some may even require a more hands-on approach. It all depends on the criticality of the supplier and the opportunity for win-win improvements. A procurement organization will generally manage three types of supplier relationships: Tactical Relationships (Mail Carrier Relationships): A mail carrier delivers your mail every morning without you having to check up on him or her. And while you could certainly suggest ways to optimize the mail route, chances are the mail carrier has things under control. In that same way, transactional suppliers largely prefer a hands-off approach. There might be an annual review or metric reports but there usually aren t any two-way feedback sessions or senior management involved. These suppliers usually handle less critical categories and aren t necessarily business critical. Collaborative Supplier Relationships (Neighbor Relationships): You and your neighbor might coordinate on barbeques or community gardens. It s not the closest type of relationship but there is some two-way feedback happening. In that same way, collaborative suppliers should have active performance management and two-way communication, even if it is on a less frequent cadence or depth. There might be annual continuous improvement goals, limited senior management participation, and active quarterly performance reports. Both the organization and the supplier have a platform to recommend development opportunities or operational efficiencies. Strategic Suppliers (Roommate Relationships): A roommate lives in the same household and is a daily partner for planning lunch, doing chores, and managing the home. Communication is extremely frequent and there is plenty of room for collaboration and cooperation. Just like roommates, Strategic suppliers are the closest type of supplier relationship, reserved for large critical categories or categories in which development opportunities abound. The LTL Freight Example above was an example of a strategic relationship. If an organization cannot ship products, then a huge disruption occurs. Strategic Partnerships will have frequent supplier performance reports and formal two-way feedback sessions. They will likely involve senior management participation and meetings will focus on supplier development opportunities and continuous improvement. Both the organization and the supplier will frequently recommend operational or contract changes that result in mutual benefits related to cost, quality, or service. As procurement professionals, we are tasked with managing the Supplier Relationship throughout its lifecycle. Participating in proactive Supplier Relationship Management will improve the cost, quality, and service of that relationship and make suppliers feel like they are being valued and appreciated. The benefits to such an approach are immeasurable. https: procureability.com supplier-performance-partnerships",

    "text": "Contract Prep: Owner Vs. Contractor Contingency Contract contingency clauses are widely applied in the construction and utility industry where cost can be ambiguous until work begins. Many companies reserve 5-10 of the total budget to account for uncertain occurrences and events that will likely result in additional costs. There are two main types of contingencies: owner contingency and contractor contingency. Owner contingency is defined as an owner s reserve amount set aside for scope modifications and additions. Any changes to scope that are not included in the initial bid will be paid for with the owner contingency. Contractor contingency are funds that are incorporated into the contractor s budget to account for various risks and situations that could not be previously anticipated. Money is set aside to account for any errors that occur on behalf of the contractor. The following are some examples of situations in which contingency clauses are useful: Owner contingency: Small to medium scope changes that are needed to meet specifications Minor force majeure events Permit approval issues resulting in schedule delays Contractor Contingency: Missed details or incorrect calculations in original bid Minor changes requested by owner that were not contemplated in the original scope Equipment and material cost growth during project Contingency clauses can easily become a sore point for both parties if details are not discussed prior to signature. To maintain and ensure a strong supplier relationship, contingency clauses should be part of a transparent discussion from the beginning. The combined project team should establish a clear understanding of who has what authority to assign contingency funds to cover actual project costs, in addition to agreeing on timing for the assignment of contingency funds. A shared savings clause can also be included to establish how to distribute unused contingencies. Both parties should also conduct a risk assessment prior to start of work to account for potential contingency uses. During project performance, there should be constant, visible communication regarding requests for and decisions to allocate contingency funds. All the parties involved in a project must understand how, when, and for what purpose the contingency funds are applied and consumed. Contingency clauses are an important option to consider including in all contracts where specifications and outcomes cannot be completely known. If best practices in Procurement are followed, they support a smooth project execution, leaving both parties happy and with a strong relationship. https: procureability.com contract-prep-owner-vs-contractor-contingency",

    "text": "Competition, Cooperation and Covid-19 We think competition can be a good thing. Collaboration between competitors can enable growth by bringing ideas together and promoting new opportunities. In the creative industries, content creators collaborate to further their outreach and brand. In the business world, this concept has a name: Coopetition. Coopetition is the concept of cooperation between competitors, where two businesses work together for a common goal or outcome. Come together to compete? Create a win-win scenario? Sure! The Covid-19 pandemic has made shifts in every way imaginable across the globe. As such, collaboration between competitors is much more critical. Here are five examples of how coopetition could be helpful to alleviate the risk that is facing many industries: Hospitals sharing data to manage the allocation of Personal Protective Equipment and other supplies Pharmaceutical companies working together to manufacture vaccines and therapeutics Food manufacturers and distribution companies allocating inventories based on need and not to the highest bidder Countries relaxing tariff laws on products that are critical to fight this pandemic Logistics companies sharing capacity and networks to ensure the timely delivery of critical products Procurement has an advantage in generating coopetition because of our holistic view of the supply market and our ability to create long-lasting, impactful supplier relationships. But, before launching headlong into coopetition, you will want to classify suppliers into two categories: Complementors and Competitors. An organization is a complementor when it is more attractive for the supplier to provide products and services to multiple organizations as opposed to your company alone. Ex. suppliers contracted by a Group Purchasing Organization. An organization is a competitor when it is more attractive for the supplier to provide products or services to a company of their choosing instead of many. Ex. delivering products to the highest bidder. Some companies will fit into both categories. Ex. the relationship between Microsoft and Intel. Once the suppliers are categorized, consider areas of collaboration. For example, if you know that Supplier A has excess inventory of a raw material that can help Supplier B complete an urgent order, offer them incentives them to work together. Or, if Supplier C can t deliver your order on time due to capacity limitations, reach out to some of your other suppliers in the area to see if they can help. As procurement professionals, we are responsible for optimizing supplier relationships to create value across supply chains. While collaborating with a competitor might seem dangerous to your bottom line, it might be the best way to manage risk, enhance capabilities, and strengthen your Supply Chain. And above all else, now more than ever, it might just be the right thing to do. https: procureability.com competition-cooperation-and-covid-19",

    "text": "Rethinking Your Supply Chain for The Transportation Industry We ve all heard the phrases unprecedented times and the new normal more times than we can count over the past year as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and global disruptions affect nearly all industries. In particular, the impacts have rattled through logistics functions since many affected regions have been at the center of international supply chains. Businesses are rapidly changing the way they operate their supply chains, so it s critical for your organization to be aware of what is happening in your market and to update your logistics sourcing strategy accordingly. Here s an overview of what s happening in the transportation markets. In addition, read on for steps you can take to protect your business and take advantage of new logistics opportunities such as: regional capacity that may mean lower rates or a leaner distribution network that aligns with changing demand. Trucking While truckload carriers were negatively impacted in Spring of 2020 from shutdowns associated with the pandemic, there has been a strong bounce back in demand. However, this demand is different than before, with increased warehouse deliveries and a shift to residential deliveries. Between the rising demand and a shortage of drivers due to COVID-19 concerns, shippers can expect to see an increase in rates. A structured approach to working with your carriers can mitigate those increases and even find opportunities to lower costs. Many companies have been turning to private or dedicated fleets to ensure capacity and service. A focused network analysis will identify areas for conversion that can lower costs as well as improve service performance. It s now more important than ever to measure your fleet performance and realign your fleet fuel, productivity, service and maintenance programs to take advantage of current market conditions. Air Travel Over the course of the past 12 months you ve likely had either a business or personal trip cancelled due to the pandemic. Since the belly space of passenger flights provides about half of the air freight capacity, the grounding of flights has generated a significant shortage in air freight capacity. These rates have risen sharply, to two- or three-times historic levels. And, with the last mile delivery shifting quickly to residential, delivery service has been unpredictable. Companies with large air freight or parcel shipments are finding value in reviewing network scenarios that can reduce the need for air transport. They re also engaging specialists to identify negotiation leverage with carriers. Ocean Freight Companies In 2019, ocean freight companies saw increases in pricing of up to 9 . However, in early 2020 U.S. owned companies saw price cuts that have effectively reversed the previous year s hikes. The sharp drop in demand earlier in 2020 was mitigated by the ocean carriers with slow steaming and idled ships. Demand is now back up, along with the rates. Increased demand is driven by PPE, restocking, and peak holiday shipping. As we enter the new year, those with cargo originating in Asia will want to keep an eye on the container shortage that is expected to continue through February. Proactive backup planning is essential to be ready for the ongoing waves expected in ocean shipping in the new year. Rail While freight levels were down with the onset of the pandemic, they have rebounded to within 3 of pre-pandemic levels. Volume increases in intermodal and agricultural commodities have offset declines in petroleum, coal and mineral products. The trend for PSR (Precision Scheduled Railroading) improved rail efficiency in general, while a focus on technology has improved intermodal service reliability. Pricing for rail services has decreased year-over-year but is moving at a predictably slow and steady pace with carload rising and intermodal falling. Analysis of your shipping patterns may reveal opportunity to switch modes and capture lower costs where improved intermodal services provide new options. Tying it All Together As the logistics industry continues to adapt and evolve with the many changes of 2020, not to mention the new challenges we will see in 2021, you must have a solid approach to support your organization s supply chain. Some Questions to Ask Yourself Is your logistics strategy aligned with overall company goals? Are your goals realistic and based on current market conditions? Setting realistic, strategic goals starts with a fact-based assessment of your capabilities and current market conditions. Have you done an in-depth network review in the last year? If not, you are missing new opportunities to protect and grow your supply chain resiliency. Does your logistics team have the skills they need to ensure your transportation sourcing strategy is effective?

    "text": "Vested Outsourcing: What is it and how can it benefit your procurement organization? When negotiating outsourcing arrangements, buyers, often led by procurement, have historically focused on their organization s needs, even at the expense of the seller. This win-lose strategy can create adversarial relationships between buyers and sellers (service providers, in this case) and damage the relationship before it even starts. Vested Outsourcing, a business model pioneered by companies as diverse as McDonald s and Microsoft, offers an alternative to the win-lose negotiation model and focuses on shared values and goals to create an outsourcing relationship that is mutually beneficial. 1 This article will cover the five rules of Vested Outsourcing to help your procurement organization transform how it views outsourcing. Outcome-based vs. transaction-based business model Focuses on the what not the how Clearly defined and measurable desired outcomes Pricing model incentives are optimized for cost service trade-offs Insight vs. oversight governance structure Outcome-based vs. Transaction-based Business Model In a transaction-based approach, outsourcing buyers typically use a competitive bid with a price-per-transaction and a goal to obtain the lowest cost per transaction. Meanwhile the service provider will be compensated on each transaction, leaving little incentive for the provider to drive efficiency to reduce transaction volume. The Vested Outsourcing model utilizes an outcome-based approach that seeks to create alignment between the outsourcing buyer and service provider. This alignment is formed by moving away from the traditional, transactional unit-pricing model, and towards an executional approach. First, both parties come to the table with desired outcomes that are able to be quantified. A few examples of these quantifiable outcomes are reliability, sustainability, cost, etc. The main objective is for the outsourcing buyer to purchase their desired outcomes and for the service provider to maximize their profit by providing the buyer with the highest completion of desired outcomes. Focus on the What not the How The Vested Outsourcing approach does not replace or minimize the underlying need for work that must get done. Vested Outsourcing further reinforces the need to outsource processes that are ripe for improvement and would benefit from being delivered by service providers who specialize in those areas. As an outsourcing buyer, the focus should be on the work being delivered and not on how the service provider delivers these results. Clearly Defined and Measurable Outcomes The Vested Outsourcing model doesn t work if all parties involved do not specifically vocalize their desired outcomes. To be successful, these outcomes should be limited to five (5) metrics that can be quantified to measure performance. By capturing the desired outcomes during both the initial planning process of the outsourcing as well as in the contract negotiation phase, both parties will be less likely to spend excess resources focusing on the wrong metrics. By setting up the outsourcing process in this way, the outsourcing buyer anchors the service provider to a particular price, that will only be paid if the provider matches the negotiated performance level. Optimize Pricing Model Incentives for Cost Service Trade-offs In addition to defining clear and measurable outcomes, a successful Vested Outsourcing event requires a pricing model that balances a cost-for-service trade-off. When establishing the pricing model, businesses should apply two principles: The pricing model must balance risk and reward for the organizations. The agreement should specify that the service provider will deliver solutions, not just activities. 2 Ultimately, the Vested Outsourcing framework allows the outsourcing buyer to reach their desired outcomes, while simultaneously incentivizing the service provider to perform at a higher level than they otherwise would in a transaction-based model. Insight vs. Oversight Governance Structure To conduct a successful Vested Outsourcing partnership, the outsourcing buyer must do their due diligence in designing the correct performance metrics and agreements. If the business manages the planning process successfully, then they will in turn choose the correct service provider to manage the work and will ultimately require less oversight and generate greater insight. Whatever the size of your procurement organization, if you are outsourcing services then there is something to be gained by exploring the Vested Outsourcing model.

    "text": "Why Procurement Organizations Need a Strategy In Place to Succeed in 2021 We are all familiar with the Q4 crunch time for Procurement; contracts are up for renewal, suppliers want to cut a deal, and stakeholders are trying to exhaust their remaining budgets. While it s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day, is it not prudent to wait until next year to develop a new procurement strategy. A recent LinkedIn poll, conducted by ProcureAbility, highlighted that many businesses have in fact turned their focus to next year s goals with achieving savings targets trailing as the second focus. Check out the poll s results here: How to Start Planning Out Your Strategy It is easy to say, focus on next year s strategy, but where do you begin? Many procurement organizations see annual planning as a time to set savings goals and to identify sourcing opportunities that will allow them to meet these goals. This is an understandable approach since it paves the way to understanding the coming year s workload, which can in turn, inform budgets, resource needs and org structure. However, rushing off to plan your savings pipeline without considering your company s business goals can quickly get you out of synch with your stakeholders. Instead of jumping to the savings plan, it s helpful to take a step back and assess what the business wants you to deliver and how you can meet those expectations. With this knowledge, you can set an intentional plan and strategic roadmap for the coming year. 5 Steps to Creating a Procurement Strategy This high-level procurement assessment doesn t have to be complicated. In fact, it can be done in 5 simple steps, as shown below: Step 1: Define the corporate goal (you can also do this at the functional or stakeholder level). This can come from your company leadership, stakeholder presentations, or even your company website. Try to think as long-term as possible and engage your stakeholders as needed to understand their goals. The key is to start with business goals, not procurement-specific goals. Step 2: Identify Procurement s role in achieving that goal. What are you expected to deliver to meet the goal? How will you help the company (and your stakeholders) be successful? What is your value in the process? Step 3: Create a Requirements Checklist of items needed for successful delivery of the expectations defined in Step 2. For example, if your role is to negotiate complex IT agreements, you need resources who have that experience and have the time to devote to the project. Step 4: Identify the items in Step 3 that you can fulfill today. Be honest. For example, do you have the right market intelligence? Do you have sufficient category expertise on the team? Step 5: Compare the results from Steps 3 and 4 to identify gaps obstacles and potential solutions to close them. Once you have completed these steps, you will clearly see where you need to focus and how you can get on the path to success. These elements can formulate your strategy for the next 12 months, and beyond. Common Pitfalls to Avoid in Your Strategy Creation The most common challenge facing procurement organizations that don t think through their strategy this way is an overwhelming load of reactive, tactical work if your stakeholders don t see that you have a clear plan to help them, they will wait to engage you until the last possible moment. Thinking higher-level and longer-term requires Procurement to consider how it supports the company as a whole. Procurement has a big job ahead in 2021; after a year like 2020, we must appreciate the importance of a strategic plan to drive the organization to achieve its full potential.

    "text": "Get Ahead of the Next Disruption with Supply Chain Resiliency Supply Chain Resiliency has become an often quoted phrase of late in business conversations and planning meetings and for good reason. The COVID-19 pandemic caught the world by surprise and very few organizations were prepared for what was to come. Because of this, Supply Chain Resiliency has quickly graduated from a thought exercise to a competitive advantage that can make or break a company s response to future disasters. What is a Resilient Supply Chain? Resiliency is the ability quickly recover from an unpredictable disaster situation, like a global pandemic. But what is it that makes a Supply Chain actually resilient? There are many factors that contribute to a supply chain s ability to quickly recover from an unpredictable event, including: A thoughtfully diversified supply base The ability to view and assess the performance and risk exposure across your entire supply base Regularly updated and rigorously tested scenario plans A Thoughtfully Diversified Supply Base COVID-19 has highlighted the need for many organizations to reduce the reliance on obtaining critical products from a sole source. It is essential that organizations begin assessing essential goods and services and begin building secondary supply bases to mitigate the risk of sole sourcing. For example, a client recently contacted us to help identify secondary sources of supply that would be needed if the Asian borders became further impacted due to COVID-19. They didn t have an immediate need to replace the current supplier, but they were beginning to form contingency plans. If your organization relies heavily on overseas suppliers, it may be wise to begin assessing the feasibility of locating an on-shore or near-shore sources of supply. The Ability to View and Assess the Performance and Risk Exposure Across Your Entire Supply Base Managing the entirety of your supply base may seem like an impossible task, but luckily the Pareto principle makes this task much easier. Segmenting suppliers into their appropriate tier (see our blog on Krajlic s Matrix) allows for your organization to better identify on which suppliers to focus your attention. Creating strategic partnerships with your critical suppliers can improve performance and allow your organization to consistently monitor the pulse of your most important suppliers. Mapping the critical portions of your supply base beyond the Tier 1 level allows you to better understand and address hidden risks. Regularly Updated and Rigorously Tested Scenario Plans A large component of being able to recover from a disaster is knowing what (and what not!) to do when disaster strikes. Scenario planning allows organizations to take a look at the current and potential risks to their Supply Chain and develop a series of potential scenarios. Organizations can be proactive and use the most likely scenarios as business cases for implementing changes to address and mitigate the major risks to their Supply Chain. Successful scenario planning requires regularly updated scenario plans along with continuous monitoring of the risks to your Supply Chain the earlier risks are detected, the better prepared your organization will be. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the world and the way we do business in ways that very few expected. Building a resilient Supply Chain is one of the most effective tools that organizations can utilize to help make corrective actions when disaster strikes again. https: procureability.com get-ahead-of-the-next-disruption-with-supply-chain-resiliency",

    "text": "Five Steps to Setup a Supplier Performance Management Program Many Procurement teams overlook supplier performance after a sourcing event. Simply handing a contract to your Operations team is all too easy! However, maintaining a strong supplier performance management program is key to building a competitive supply base and ensuring strong supplier relationships. Follow this 5-step process to establish a supplier performance program of your own. Choose the right Key Performance Indicators (KPI s) To choose the right KPI s, start by asking this question: What are your business needs and goals? Each industry and each company needs something different, so Procurement and Operations teams should select KPI s that prioritize those goals. For example, on-time delivery is highly important to retail companies, whereas safety is important to utility companies. After identifying business needs, ask this question: What are you purchasing? The right KPI s vary for each category. KPI s commonly fall into 4 categories: Delivery Logistics Quality Service Pricing Contract Terms Safety Environment Establish Service Level Agreements Business needs may be stringent or relaxed, so plan for the right service levels and hold suppliers accountable. For example, retail companies need to have strict delivery requirements for carriers to meet demand. Some high-velocity retail operations require carriers to deliver within a 15-minute window, early or late deliveries can severely disrupt warehouse operations. On the other hand, on-time delivery may not be as important to a utility company expecting a semi-annual delivery of wood poles that could be delivered anytime within a week. Just remember, requiring and enforcing high levels of service comes with a cost. Track Performance Determine what to measure then determine how to measure it. Tracking supplier performance is best done quantitatively. Data from applied available business systems provide a directly quantitative way to measure suppliers. For example, data from a Transportation Management System or Warehouse Management System should provide information on the expected and the actual time of delivery, which would provide on-time delivery insights. Many times, however, tracking performance with data is difficult since quality or delivery may be very complex, as is common with services. To quantify service quality, you can apply a standard rating scale (i.e. 1-5 or 1-10) to rate supplier quality or service levels. For example, to rate the performance of a construction firm, you could rate their Customer Service, Site Cleanliness, or XXXXX on a scale of 1-10. These criteria are not easily measured quantitatively, but applying a rating scale helps you numerically show the supplier and your stakeholders how the supplier is performing. When tracking performance, keep a historical record of the scores to analyze performance trends over time. Are suppliers improving? Or getting worse? Address Performance To address performance, set a cadence for delivering feedback. Deliver feedback to more important suppliers more often and deliver feedback to less important suppliers less often. You may meet in-person with your key suppliers quarterly, whereas less important suppliers may only receive an annual email with a performance report. Because performance tracking is quantitative, suppliers will more easily understand how they have performed: whether it s acceptable or unacceptable and how they rank among their peers. Take Action Incentivize strong performance and correct poor performance this step is very important for a well-maintained process. Examples of Incentivizing your suppliers are: providing a financial bonus or public recognition. Blue-Ribbon programs go a long way! Examples of Correcting supplier performance: are helping them refine their processes, improving communication between your operations teams and theirs, or removing them entirely. Following this 5-step process will allow you to build stronger supplier relationships and to strengthen your business! Giving suppliers feedback and letting them know how they are performing gives them insight that they may not have. So be sure to pick the right KPI s, measure them quantitatively, address suppliers performance, and take action to ensure they are delivering what you need! https: procureability.com five-steps-to-setup-a-supplier-performance-management-program",

    "text": "Kraljic s Matrix: 4 Drivers of Category Management Strategy Listen to this article 4 min When business demands cause procurement teams to transition from being transactional tactical groups into teams with strategic roles in the firm, the tools and approaches used by organizations to realize savings must also evolve. During the planning stages of category management, which factors are most important to ensure the best outcome when navigating the supply market? Viewing a category strategy from the lens of Kraljic s Matrix is just one of many ways to understand where opportunities lie and how value can be created. This tool considers two factors to drive strategy: Business Impact (Internal) (How critical is this category to the goals and operations of the business?) Categories with low business impact are characterized by low expenditure levels, small influence in key functions, as well as tolerance for lengthy lead times before the product is received. The opposite is true for high impact categories these are identified by high percentages of spend, direct consequence to core business functions, and high sensitivity to delivery windows. Supply Risk Market Complexity (External) (How hard is it to create competition among suppliers?) Low supply risk low complexity categories offer many options, clear buyer leverage, and minimal complications. Categories with high risk and complexity are often handled by a small number of highly technical suppliers, limiting negotiation leverage. Once these characteristics of a category have been identified and placed on the graph above, the following framework provides a clear path forward when contemplating potential next steps for your category plan: Kraljic s Category Classification Key Strategies Strategic (High Impact, High Complexity) Continuous availability is critical and designs specifications are often nuanced. Few suppliers might have the technical capacity to fulfill needs, making substitution difficult. High executive visibility and involvement is needed. Collaboration in Innovation Joint Process Improvement Relationship Restructuring Focus on Total Cost of Ownership Multiple Organizational Levels of Involvement Focus on Long Term Availability Diversification Leverage (High Impact, Low Complexity) Commonly the largest portion of spend and key to core operations. These categories typically have medium visibility throughout an organization and offer many opportunities for substitute suppliers products. Exploit Purchasing Power Focus on Cost Unit Minimize Acquisition Costs Global Sourcing Volume Incentive Negotiations Bottleneck (Low Impact, High Complexity) Unique specifications and technical capabilities of suppliers are critical here, however, demand is typically low non-critical. These categories can be characterized by fluctuating demand and potential storage risk. Value Analysis Cross-Functional Cross-Organizational Teams Cost Driver Management Reduce Exposure to Price Increases Supply Disruptions Target Pricing Ensure Short Term Supply Eliminate Long Term Need Non-Critical (Low Impact, Low Complexity) Highly standard products that contribute little to business outcomes with low visibility. Transaction processing costs often outweigh the potential value. Best Price Evaluation Demand Management Volume Concentration Efficient Processing Minimize Time Acquiring With a clear vision of how outcomes in your category impact the overall business, you can feel confident in developing a well-prepared plan to engage suppliers. Benefit from improved partner relationships and better outcomes for business operations by taking a proactive approach to anticipate organizational needs and market dynamics by using tools such as Kraljic s Matrix. https: procureability.com kraljics-matrix-4-drivers-of-category-management-strategy",

    "text": "4 Important Skills to Look for When Building a Procurement Team As Procurement Teams shift from being a tactical function in the accounting department to a strategic function within the supply chain, the skills required of procurement top performers are shifting as well. What skills does it take to drive results in today s procurement organizations? Below are 4 competencies that today s procurement superstars seem to share. Data Analysis and Synthesis In the right hands, data is a powerful and valuable tool for decision making; in the wrong hands, data can be meaningless or, if used incorrectly, even damaging to an organization. Procurement professionals are required to analyze large sets of data including, but not limited to, category market data and internal historical procurement data. From this, they are expected to then act as a strategic advisor, assisting the business in developing category strategies, negotiation plans, and pricing models. Today s top procurement professionals can analyze and synthesize large data sets, drawing meaningful conclusions from raw data. Top prospects should have demonstrated experience pulling data from Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP ) systems and being able to make recommendations based on that data. Flexibility Procurement s role in organizations has evolved, and the role is expected to expand. Procurement professionals roles have shifted from that of a transactional resource, processing Purchase Orders only, to that which resembles a hybrid Project Manager, Financial Analyst, Data Engineer, and much more. Day to day, a strategic purchasing professional s itinerary isn t mundane or repetitive. These individuals should be fluid in their role, understanding the importance of being such and thriving on new challenges. An ideal prospect has the ability to switch gears between thinking big picture and being detail-oriented to maximize results; often, these need to be working in tandem. Relationship Management Gone are the days of silo ed purchasing teams, and here are the days of the extremely visible procurement team built to serve its organization. These teams are now becoming an essential piece of the business s internal service chain, maintaining close connections with every business unit. In the pursuit of managing multiple, complex relationships, procurement professionals are becoming skilled relationship managers, building their communication skills and keeping a service mindset at the forefront. Project Management Think of the modern procurement specialist as being not unlike that of a project manager, in charge of multiple impactful projects at one time. Stakeholders often include those in executive roles, contrasted with the Subject Matter Experts close to the product service being procured. As procurement organizations shift from tactical to strategic, each sourcing project should be treated like a complex project through the lens of a project manager. Effective Project Managers have the ability to coordinate schedules, lead projects, juggle multiple stakeholders, hold people accountable, and drive long-lasting results. Whether you re a procurement professional looking to advance your career, or a manager looking to build your procurement team, we recommend honing in on these skills to achieve the results you re looking for. https: procureability.com 4-important-skills-to-look-for-when-building-a-procurement-team",

    "text": "Hard vs Soft Cost Savings in Procurement Differentiating between hard savings and soft savings is one of the many responsibilities that fall to Procurement professionals. While the preferred method may vary from one organization to another, a standardized method of measuring savings is crucial to produce credible, meaningful results. What Are Hard Cost Savings ? Definition: Hard cost savings can be described as tangible reductions that directly affect the company s bottom line. Year over Year (YoY) savings achieved by purchasing in bulk Actions that directly affect the company s bottom line Cost or asset reductions that directly happen as a result of process technology policy improvements Cost reductions of existing products or services, contractual agreements, or processes Cost reductions paid for items procured in comparison to prices paid for the prior 12 months Examples Include: Reduced baseline Reduction in resources based on targeted cuts Savings from budgeted spend Volume reductions shrinking the amount of goods or services used Refunds Rebates Payments made by vendors as a result of increased spend or a savings project What Are Soft Cost Savings Avoidance ? Definition: Soft cost savings avoidance can be described as actions that lower potential price increases so that a company does not have as many costs in the future. Does not lower the cost of products services when compared against historical results, but mitigates the effect of cost increases Unpriced items offered as incentives by vendors Increased output capacity without increasing resource expenditure, the soft cost savings are the amount that would have been spent to account for the increased volume output, and Process improvements that positively impact efficiency, productivity, customer satisfaction, etc.; over time, the cost avoidance becomes cost savings. Examples include: In-Contract cost avoidance results from Procurement intervention(s) to mitigate price increases Free training, maintenance, or upgrades negotiated as part of the purchase While there is a big focus on bottom line, hard savings, it is very common for Procurement teams to track both hard cost savings and cost avoidance. In order to effectively measure the value that Procurement brings to the table, there must be standardized methodologies that follow the organization s values. Procurement should regularly meet with the Executive and Finance teams to align on the true value that Procurement is achieving through both streams.

    "text": "Stakeholder Engagement Procurement Stakeholder engagement is a common challenge for Procurement and is one of the most important pieces contributing to organizational success. For those unfamiliar with this process, stakeholder engagement is the process of interacting and communicating with decision-making parties within a company to strategize the outcome of an organizational goal. When executed effectively, stakeholder engagement and management can lead to synergistic strategic alignment between a procurement function and the internal stakeholders they support. Poor stakeholder engagement can contribute to an organization s dark purchasing, purchasing that does not go through the proper procurement channels, which can result in greater exposure to risks and imprudent spending. Strategy Development Stakeholder engagement techniques are vital skills to learn as a procurement professional, but like many best practices, are most effective when approached strategically. On a team-level, develop strategies for your different stakeholders based on their observed habits, the type of work they process, and the complexity of their sourcing categories. Understanding how to prioritize the projects with your various stakeholders can allow you to focus your time where it matters the most. Communication Alongside procurement strategy development, communication is an important pillar supporting stakeholder engagement and management. Effective communication will allow for Procurement to align with stakeholder s needs. The time and path taken to effectively communicate a message in a one-one-one meeting or group setting will vary, but the constant is ensuring stakeholders are prepared to engage in the procurement process. What do they need to get started? Keys to Improve Stakeholder Communication: Understand the audience Communicate with stakeholders in terms they can understand. Overcomplicating the message with procurement-specific terminology can dilute the point of the message. Maintain communication Frequent communication is vital to understanding workstreams in a stakeholder s pipeline. Consider establishing a newsletter or a monthly check-in. During ongoing projects, maintaining consistent communication with stakeholders provides transparency to the procurement process and can be rewarded with increased confidence in the process. Proactivity Engage stakeholders as early as possible to minimize the chances of delays or other unforeseen setbacks in the procurement process. This is especially the case for newer relationships, where those expectations have not yet been established. Stakeholder engagement is key to stakeholder management as well as the overall procurement process. Contacting stakeholders to develop relationships, to understand the details of their procurement project pipeline, and to maintain consistency in communication will allow for an organization to achieve its goals as effectively as possible. https: procureability.com stakeholder-engagement-procurement",

    "text": "Achieving Strategic Fit for Procurement Listen to this article 5 min Strategic Fit may be defined as matching resources and capabilities but in Procurement it means requiring that both the competitive and supply chain strategies of a company have aligned goals. To deliver the highest level of service, procurement organizations must achieve Strategic Fit. Achieving Strategic Fit can be as easy as understanding 1, 2, 3: Customer Requirements Uncertainties Procurement s Capabilities Procurement Responsiveness Step 1 Understanding Customer Requirements Uncertainties Procurement leaders must first understand broader business and customer needs before making a purchase. This discovery process should involve gaining a comprehensive understanding of the customer s project scope, goals and budget. In addition to covering the basic information Procurement requires, the customer will likely also have their own set of requirements and uncertainties. When identifying Customer Requirements Uncertainties, it is important to establish an initial Voice of Customer (VOC) with the customer. An effective way to do this is through scheduling a call or meeting to understand some basic information such as: Quality Reliability Availability Rework or Scrap Cost Budget or Target Spend Target Purchase Price Residual Value Delivery Lead Times Turnaround Times Cycle Times Service Safety Service Requirements After-purchase Reliability Customer Required Maintenance Corporate Responsibility Diverse Business Enterprise Ethical Business conduct Environmental Sustainability By connecting with the customer to review a basic list of procurement requirements, not only is Procurement able to establish the Critical Customer Requirements (CCR); they ve taken the first step toward further growing relationships with their colleagues and suppliers. Step 2 Understanding Procurement Capabilities Once the VOC has been gathered the next step is to build on the initial discovery in order to generate Critical Customer Requirements (CCR). CCR is commonly practiced across Lean Six Sigma but can be leveraged to understand and meet the needs of Procurement s customer. Translating VOC to CCR can be quite simple dependent upon customer compliance and Procurement s ability to capture VOC. When translating Voice of Customer to Critical Customer Requirements it is important to keep the following in mind: Important to The Customer ( Customer Cares ) Value Proposition Specifies Requirements ( Must-Have or Must Be ) Ultimately Satisfy Potentially Delight Can Be Measured Establishes A Target Customer Specifications Acceptable Range of Performance In some cases, translating Voice of Customer to a Critical Customer Requirement can be straightforward, such as Lead Time. In other cases, a customer may still be uncertain as to what they are looking for and it is Procurement s responsibility to guide them within existing procurement capabilities to achieve their goals. Step 3 Procurement Responsiveness The final step in Achieving Strategic Fit is to match customer requirements to the procurement organization s capabilities. This may be achieved through utilizing the already translated CCRs to enable an appropriate level of procurement responsiveness. For example, a large consumer product distributor may require more responsive procurement due to product variability, or seasonal demand. Procurement would respond by enabling additional suppliers or working with suppliers to increase existing manufacturing capacity. The graphic below represents the Zone of Strategic Fit and how Procurement s responsiveness will vary based on customer requirements and uncertainty. Strategic Fit Achieved While it can be challenging to initially achieve strategic fit, once achieved, it can become much easier to control the value generated by Procurement. This is because achieving strategic fit is an effort to support both the customer and Procurement in their own goals. For procurement, this often involves identifying supply and demand at the lowest possible cost. Achieving Strategic Fit allows Procurement to align their goals with the greater business needs.

    "text": "Approaching Procurement Opportunities with a Systems Thinking Mindset A system is simply a collection of elements that are interconnected in many ways to accomplish a certain function. Learning how to think in systems is important because it provides a new perspective of how certain processes operate on a granular level. Systems thinking helps to expose the root causes of ongoing problems and to promote a targeted approach for improving results. Procurement professionals can benefit from systems thinking by using the following framework to approach all opportunities for managing spend. Everything can be viewed as a system, no systems are perfect, and all systems are composed of three main parts: Elements The individual components that make up the system Interconnections How the elements interact with other elements Function(s) The overall goal or purpose the system is intended to accomplish Viewing opportunities through a systems mindset allows one to quickly cut through the surface-level symptoms of the problem that is being addressed and go straight to the root causes. Once the root causes have been identified, it becomes much simpler to make targeted improvements that will directly lead to a more desirable outcome. Understanding how to break down processes into systems is highly beneficial for making targeted, quantifiable improvements without having to go through a total redesign. When approaching any broadly defined opportunities, exploring the situation from different perspectives can be the difference between finding a good solution and a great one. All problems can also be put through this framework, and when they are broken down into elements, interconnections, and function(s) some clear areas for improvement will arise. Here is a relatable example to demonstrate the use of a system. Problem A common problem in business is busy inboxes and slow response times to email. Elements Elements in this system include the email account(s), computer, phone, outside senders, recipients, and email reminders. A follow-up email from the original sender serves the same purpose as a personal reminder, but which is most time-efficient? Interconnections The interconnections of this system are largely determined by the number of devices that you use to manage your emails and the number of email accounts that you manage. In this case, if you are just using your phone and computer to manage emails, it is important to verify that they are properly synced. Additionally, when multiple email accounts are being managed simultaneously, it is important for them to be connected through the same service for the sake of convenience and consistency. Function(s) If the function of the potential system is to lower response times to emails it would be best to re-evaluate reminders so fewer requests slip through the cracks. Now that the problem has been identified (missing reminders), determine what qualifies as reminder-worthy. Moving forward, whenever a request meets the criteria, immediately set a follow-up reminder and at certain predetermined check-in points during each day, allocate some time to clear through your reminder queue. Systems allow users to quickly identify root causes of problems and make small, targeted improvements to the elements and interconnections of a given system. In procurement, there are always going to be better approaches for evaluating potential suppliers and managing spend, so sometimes viewing your current opportunities through a systems thinking mindset is all it takes to make major improvements in your daily workflow. When there s always room for improvement and anything can be viewed as a system, there are no problems too large or too abstract to approach confidently.

Meadows (Pictured below). https: procureability.com approaching-procurement-opportunities-with-a-systems-thinking-mindset",

    "text": "Purchasing Transaction Costs Why They Are Trending Down Transaction costs are costs incurred during the process of buying and selling on top of the unit price. They can include legal fees, communication charges, labor required to bring something to market and the cost to determine the item s price. Transaction costs impact the procurement life cycle by increasing turn times, vendor selection times, and the total cost of ownership (TCO). The latest trends in technology and procurement show the continued race to the bottom. There are 3 major transaction costs associated with past and future trends that can impact procurement. Three types of Transaction Costs: Search and information costs: those incurred to determine if a required product is available in the market, who has the lowest price, the relative utility and functionality of the product and the potential service costs of using the product on an ongoing basis. Bargaining costs: those required to reach an acceptable transaction agreement and writing executing the contract. Policing and enforcement costs: those to ensure the other party sticks to the terms of the contract and to take appropriate action if not. Steve Banker, 2011 Search and Information Costs The internet impacts all types of transaction costs, but with the use of review sites, online marketplaces, and browser searches, the cost of information has drastically been reduced because information is so available. Alternatively, services costs have been on the rise with SAAS (Software as a Service) business IT models reducing vertical integration costs (infrastructure, maintenance, personal, etc.) but an overall reduction in costs is still seen in this category. A trend that is becoming more common involves switching costs from software vendors who use the SAAS model. There can be an increased cost due to the inability of companies to gain keep record of valuable business data, change process management costs, and business intelligence from software vendors. Bargaining Costs The smallest change is found here because it is the most human cost. The latest trends in this category is the explosion of virtual gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual video conferencing software, virtual signatures, and email help reduce the costs of getting to acceptable agreements. Contract database and software that highlights amended contracts are also beginning to gain momentum in reducing the cost and increasing the speed of drawing up an agreement. Policing and Enforcement Costs Since 2010, the use of: artificial intelligence, machine learning, parts cataloging, and virtual currencies has reduced leakage, unethical practices, and maverick purchasing within companies. Software solutions offer procure-to-pay and source-to-pay suites allowing firms the ability to lock-in and drive negotiated contract prices. Automation, through these solutions, sorts and enforces procurement rules further resulting in reduced leakage, reduced maverick spend, and stewardship contract term requirements. The advent of virtual currencies paired with smart contracts shows how the currency was paid through its life cycle providing companies with the knowledge and ability to track ethically sourced spending. From mass outsourcing of non-core activities to nearshoring (outsourcing to a nearby country, often one that shares a border), transaction costs continue to decline as companies find new and creative ways to complete transactions. Additionally, innovation and the intranet have enabled automation of business required, non-value added, tasks of: goods receipt posting, payment matching, and approval routing. These trends showcase how companies are looking inward outward to reduce procurement costs resulting in bandwidth to focus on higher value-added activities. https: procureability.com purchasing-transaction-costs-why-they-are-trending-down",

    "text": "How to Increase Supplier Diversity Spend Recent social movements have highlighted the crucial need for companies to not only communicate a commitment to diversity and inclusion but to take meaningful action incorporating those values into their operations. Supplier diversity does this by increasing opportunities for socially or economically disadvantaged groups to participate in the supply chain. However, increasing diverse spend can be challenging while maintaining existing processes and managing demands to consolidate overall spend. Here are six steps you can take for sustainable growth in supplier diversity at your company: Bridge Gaps Within Your Organization Often supplier diversity is championed by a corporate citizenship team without full stakeholder buy-in. Start by ensuring that all internal business partners and leaders are aware of the strong business case for supplier diversity and have incentives in place to achieve shared goals. Create mechanisms of accountability such as including diverse spend metrics on balanced scorecards reported to the executive team and designating supplier diversity champions within each category or department. Customize Your Approach By Category It is often easier to find and qualify diverse suppliers in some procurement categories rather than others, such as marketing services for communicating to diverse consumer audiences versus emerging technology only offered by a few large suppliers. To customize your approach; Conduct internal surveys or interviews to understand which categories present the largest challenge and or opportunity at your company. Join professional networks, industry forums, or organizations like the Billion Dollar Roundtable to learn how peer organizations representatives, working within those categories, are achieving similar goals. Seek out creative models that best fit your category s needs, such as forming a strategic alliance between prime and diverse suppliers or using a diverse supplier as an aggregator for other suppliers. Actively Encourage Participation Some potential suppliers may qualify as diverse, but have not yet pursued official certification or knew to include it in their proposal. Clearly communicate on your company website how potential suppliers can qualify as a diverse supplier and the value that you see from such partnerships. It is good practice to set a standard to always including a question about supplier diversity in your RFPs. Utilize Certification Agencies The organizations that certify diverse suppliers share your goal to increase opportunities for diverse suppliers. Keep them informed of upcoming procurement needs, and they can facilitate connections with qualified and diverse supplier options. You can even encourage member(s) of your leadership to serve on a certification agency board in order to gain more insight into diverse suppliers needs and the certification process. Provide Executive Mentoring Once you do find diverse suppliers to participate in the bidding process, help set them up for long-term success. Post resources or host seminars on how to do business with your company and provide constructive feedback to those that do not win an RFP. When you do start a supplier relationship with a diverse supplier, consider offering scholarships for executive training or creating a mentoring program with members of your company s diversity resource groups in order to aid their growth. These strategic steps to increasing your supplier diversity will still take time and resources, but they will enable you to change the status quo and eventually create a truly inclusive supply chain. As a result, your company can have a more meaningful social and economic impact in your community, as well as drive increased competition and innovation, ensure compliance with government requirements, and improve both employee and customer engagement with your brand. https: procureability.com how-to-increase-supplier-diversity-spend",

    "text": "Market Basket Approach to RFP Have you ever released an RFP with thousands of items or complex, highly engineered components? Consider a market basket approach to your RFP. A market basket is a representative sample of the entire spend an organization intends to take out to market for quotation. When the market basket technique is used, the RFP will include only the subset of items that make up the representative sample instead of all items in the category. By reducing the number of items included in the RFP, suppliers spend less time completing the RFP, which allows them to focus on the accuracy and detail of their quote. The market basket approach also saves time and simplifies the internal analysis of supplier responses due to the reduction in line items quoted by suppliers Three steps to decide market basket sample: 80 20 Rule start with the 20 of parts that drive 80 of the category spend Part families review to ensure all types of items are included; then include exclude parts to ensure all part types are accurately represented Cats and Dogs pull in low volume and low spend items to complete your market basket By following the three steps above, the market basket will be a truly representative sample of the entire category spend. A common pitfall when developing a market basket is following only one of the three steps above puts the RFP at risk of not representing all items. For example, not including low volume or low spend items can misrepresent your organization s spend to suppliers. This could result in issues during implementation, forcing the release of a second RFP or lengthy supplier follow-up discussions. If you don t provide all items in the RFP, how can you trust that suppliers will provide reasonable prices fr non-market basket items? Pricing mechanisms for non-market basket items should ensure your organization does not lose savings, especially on low volume and low spend parts, as well as provide visibility into the pricing for new items in the future. There are multiple mechanisms seen in the marketplace. Options include: For categories that include thousands of items, consider a high-level formulaic approach such as Cost Plus or List Minus. This approach is quick and simple. If following a Cost-Plus model, make sure your organization and the supplier agree on a detailed cost model with visibility of all cost buckets. For complex, highly engineered items, consider asking suppliers to quote the non-market basket items similar to the items they are being considered for award. Pricing for these types of items may be significantly impacted by several factors, including engineering costs and volume. While this is time-consuming, waiting until after award will save your organization time in the number of items to review as well as reducing the total amount of items suppliers would be asked to quote if all items were included in an RFP. Before deciding on the strategy for non-market basket items, align with key stakeholders who are impacted by the RFP, such as finance teams. Gain buy-in for the RFP strategy by explaining the market basket approach and options for non-market basket pricing. This will also serve as an approval of savings calculations resulting from the RFP. You can share this blog with teammates who you think could benefit from learning more about this strategy! Following a market basket approach for an RFP significantly reduces time spent by your organization while also providing all the information you need to make an accurate and detailed analysis across the entire spend. Remember that the market basket is a representative sample of the entire spend start with the high value and high spend items, but always ensure all types of items are represented in the market basket.

    "text": "Procurement Strategies for Managing the Impacts of COVID-19 As the global pandemic spreads, billions of people and businesses are suffering from financial loss, and it is hard to be optimistic. Procurement leaders and business executives must respond quickly to maintain operations, fulfill demands and alleviate supply chain disruptions. Procurement strategies can help companies minimize the impacts of the pandemic by mitigating increased costs. While the duration of COVID-19 is hard to predict, the business leaders must develop both short and long-term procurement plans. Short Term Strategies: Assess or Reassess Supplier Management Historically, many companies outsource raw materials and finished products from Asian countries to cut production costs. However, COVID-19 affects suppliers productivity across multiple geographical areas, especially at the heart of many Asian supply chains. The situation forces corporations to find alternative sources of supply to fulfill customers demand. To secure the supply base, leaders need to engage with their primary suppliers to assess the risks and forecast impacts on the operation. Based on the evaluation, the leaders might consider shifting to local suppliers to have more control and visibility of future procurement. Internal Evaluation Internal evaluation is critical in helping companies limit the pandemic s implications. It helps to cut costs and to increase the supply chain efficiency. In order to conduct internal evaluations, the company needs to first, gather data and quantify the impact of supply reductions on demand fulfillment. Next, the company will have to assess operational risks for different business functions. Lastly, communicate with key stakeholders to understand goals for the next quarter then develop a strategy, considering multiple scenarios, to meet those goals. Long Term Strategies: Incorporate Emergency Planning into Current Structure If you take the glass half full approach, adversity can lead to prosperity. While the pandemic damages the supply chain and disrupts company growth, it also exposes weaknesses. To help organizations recover, business executives can take actions to embed risk management into budgeting, sourcing, and payment. Avoid relying on one or two suppliers and always have back-ups available. As the pandemic lingers, take the opportunity to step back and assess the current structure relative to the new normal. COVID-19 forces us to not only face intercompany and global economic disruptions, it challenges us to be better than ever. Work with stakeholders to build new solutions to new problems and to old problems, Assess all parts of the business and figure out how to not just survive but thrive and make organizations stronger than ever.

    "text": "Supply Chain and the Design Thinking Process Supply chain is all about solving complex problems and supply chain professionals find ways to optimize, to create efficiencies and to change and build processes. An effective supply chain captures value There are many tools and methodologies deployed to realize this value. Some of the most popular concepts in the efficiency movement are: Six Sigma Total Quality Management (TQM) Lean Manufacturing Outsourcing Digitization When focused on capturing value and driving efficiency, it is easy to lose sight of creating the value itself. It is critical, that before the resources are allocated and teams are formed, time is spent finding and defining the real problem then identifying the target audience and understanding how they are affected by this problem before jumping into solving it. Time to embrace the Design Thinking Process Design Thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success. Tim Brown, President and CEO of IDEO. A core characteristic of the Design Thinking Process is keeping the user at the center (user-centric). In fact, innovative solutions are formed at the overlap of three elements: Business, Technology and Human Values. It may sound simple, but it s surprising how many new solutions, dashboards, reports and or services are implemented without clarity on who will utilize them and how. We should take the time to actually understand how users are going to interact with these, if their needs will be satisfied, and what value will it add to the business. This approach is a common practice in design and tech agencies today and can be exceptionally valuable to our organizations. Creating Value (Design Thinking) Capturing Value (Efficiency Methodologies) Competitive Advantage The Design Thinking Process is iterative, and it repeats until a proper solution is established. It is well noted by Michael Graber, Managing Partner at Southern Growth Studio that Design Thinking is a method for business growth, but the benefits go as deep for your company as they do for customers. Supply Chain professionals are encouraged to embrace the Design Thinking Process to not only develop new innovative solutions but to get their companies (or their procurement organizations) to the next step of greater success and growth.

    "text": "Five Key Elements for Presenting Procurement Information to Executives There is a problem in business we can all identify with getting a meeting on an executive s or decision maker s calendar. Once a meeting is scheduled, Procurement teams frequently struggle to convey their message in a way that is easy to understand and meaningful to a business executive. This article will cover five key elements of an effective executive presentation that will help make the most of your time with executives. Defining your objective and its significance to the audience Conveying an organized and structured message Communicating your arguments clearly and simply Verifying your presentation is spotless, and you are prepared to present with confidence Delivering your message effectively Defining your objective and its significance to the audience At the beginning of your presentation, it is imperative to define the objective of the meeting and to explain why the audience should care. As Procurement experts, we are often focused on driving cost savings for our line of business, it is important to think about who the meeting attendees are, their primary concerns, and why they should care about the topic that you want to discuss. An effective presentation should lead the audience to a call to action such as approving the funding of a new project or changing the way business is conducted. Conveying an organized and structured message When delivering a presentation, if you do not order your thoughts in a structured manner, your attendees will not be able to follow them. The presentation that you deliver should take your audience from the beginning of your meeting (point A) and move them towards your objective (Point B). There are several ways to structure an effective presentation, see the below diagram for a few examples of presentation structures that can help to deliver your message in an organized manner. Communicating your arguments clearly and simply In Procurement, we frequently dive into the granular details of a project in order to develop an effective strategy. However, when presenting to executives, it is important to only provide information that they need to know and in a manner that is easy to understand. For example, visualizing and explaining data with an effective chart is almost always more impactful than a data table or a slide that is full of text. Verifying that your presentation is spotless, and that you are prepared to present with confidence Although this point may be common sense to some, always proofread your presentation to make sure that it is formatted professionally and free from grammatical errors. Make sure you are prepared to deliver your presentation and that it flows smoothly by reviewing your presentation with the following questions in mind: How will the audience want to use this information? What order arrangement will make the information easier to understand? Will that order communicate the message effectively? Does any information bear repeating? Are there natural transitions between my paragraphs and or points? Delivering your message effectively An idea s success or failure is frequently determined by how effectively it was communicated to the decision maker. Therefore, once you have developed your presentation, always think through the most effective ways to deliver your materials. When beginning your presentation, it is important to start on time and capture your audience s attention immediately by establishing yourself and your call to action. Throughout your presentation, you should have a strategy for maintaining everyone s attention and engagement. Lastly, when finishing your presentation, reinforce your call to action and plan your last few sentences to be impactful as your final impression will last with the audience. Following these five key elements when developing and delivering your executive presentations will help you to communicate your message effectively, gain executive buy-in, and drive business results.

    "text": "Financial Impacts of Procurement Beyond Income Statement Savings Financial Impacts of Procurement Beyond Income Statement Savings There is a common misconception that the primary (or only) way procurement and finance overlap is through costs savings; however, the financial implications of procurement extend far beyond the obvious impact of a reduction in expenses and subsequent increase in savings and bottom-line profit. These include effects to the following: Income statement Balance sheet Statement of cash flows Income Statement When procurement experts are able to obtain cost reductions via strategic sourcing, companies obtain a reduction in expenses. This leads to higher earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), as well as a higher net profit. Balance Sheet Cost savings will also reward companies in the form of increased cash on hand and reduced liabilities (accounts payable). This will increase firm liquidity and help allay any potential concerns regarding firm solvency. The key purpose of capital expenditures is to generate more return via fixed assets. If a company can meet its procurement needs with fewer capital expenditures, it will generate a higher-level fixed asset turnover. This provides a higher return on assets (ROA), and investors seek out companies that can generate stronger ROAs. With the increase in net profit, stockholders become more satisfied with company performance, in part because they gain a subsequent increase in earnings per share (EPS). Finally, an increased net profit will improve a firm s retained earnings. This is the amount of net income remaining after the firm has paid out dividends to its stockholders and it is used for purposes of reinvestment within the business. Statement of Cash Flows With reduced cash outlay, business will naturally have more cash on hand to re-invest within the business. Not only is additional cash beneficial from the standpoint of better meeting debts and short-term liabilities, it also provides to opportunity to utilize cash for the purposes of investing. Why is this important? The financial savings realized from the lens of cost avoidance are not recognized by finance professionals. Furthermore, these savings are not indicated anywhere on financial statements, which downplays the importance of implementing effective procurement strategies and hiring procurement professionals to assist with the process. Procurement experts are in a unique position to significantly affect the bottom line. It is critical that companies realize the importance of procurement experts in their business practices. Once procurement professionals gauge and report the financial implications beyond dollar savings, they can then communicate these to upper-level management and shareholders.

    "text": "Circular Supply Chain Model Historically, the supply chain appeared to be linear as products were consumed and ultimately discarded in the trash. With today s focus on sustainability and reclamation of used materials, the supply chain is also adapting, transitioning to meet changing demands as a circular supply chain, the green alternative. By switching from the current industrial linear model to a circular supply chain concept, where resources are kept in use for as long as possible and even regenerate into something else at the end of each service life, companies are able to achieve sustainable growth. Therefore, in a circular supply chain environment, there is a transition from raw materials to the manufacturing process to distribution to the consumer than to waste. By embracing the journey of the reverse logistics process, the below benefits can be obtained: Save Money and Grow Business Value By focusing on reusable materials, companies can achieve maximum benefit out of the raw materials they purchase. Instead of tossing products away at the end of their life cycle, they can be re-manufactured and turned back into profit with lower costs than purchasing additional materials to build something new. This way, companies can decrease the overall production costs and successfully connect the end of the linear supply chain with the beginning. Societal Benefits of the Circular Economy Sustainability remains a hot topic in just about every industry. As consumers create more and more waste each year, it s up to not only individual consumers but also companies, to choose products that have small environmental footprints. Consumers are increasingly conscious about the impact of what their shopping decisions might have on the earth. In 2015, Nielsen polled 30,000 consumers in 60 countries around the world and found out 66 of global consumers indicate that they re willing to pay more for sustainable products. Companies should be catering to a public that is increasingly conscious of their environmental impact if they want to stay relevant among consumers and grow market share. Recycling and Reusing Protects Against Price Volatility Raw material prices are constantly changing and as a result, companies always struggle to plan their budgets and keep total costs of goods under control. The price of many categories of virgin materials varies on a day-to-day basis. Metals, for example, have seen more volatility recently than in any decade in the 20th century. By anticipating the amount of reused and recycled materials that can be used in the production of new goods, companies can more accurately gauge their expenditures and keep costs under control. Meeting Regulation Standards Many government regulations are pushing businesses to be more environmentally friendly by creating laws and regulations around recycling and waste disposal. Others are offering incentives to companies that make active efforts to go green. Either way, the end goal is to reduce the environmental impact of simply boost their bottom lines. Ultimately, adopting a circular supply chain strategy should not be viewed as a choice between being a good steward of the environment and a good business practitioner. It s both. Companies that implement a circular supply chain model can not only get more value from end-of-use products but also gain goodwill and intangible benefits of being socially responsible firms. https: procureability.com impact-of-the-circular-supply-chain",

    "text": "CalTech ProcureAbility - The Business of Blockchain\" CalTech ProcureAbility The Business of Blockchain Blockchain a digital ledger in which transactions are recorded chronologically and publicly. David Padula, from ProcureAbility, was recently invited by CalTech to participate in a panel discussion focused on the Business of Blockchain . The oversold and standing-room-only event covered a wide range of current and potential applications of the trending technology. USC Professor and founder of RSA Security, Leonard Adleman (the A in RSA), kicked off the event with an overview of blockchain. The panel then fielded Blockchain questions from moderator Ira Moskatel, an attorney with Arnold Porter, who specializes in technology. Healthcare and Privacy The digitization of medical records is a growing industry, often mandated by governments, but the panel agreed that this information should not be stored on a public Blockchain. Private Blockchain solutions exist as well as permissioned access and anonymity with Blockchains like the Hyperledger. Extreme care and caution needs to be taken when it comes to how sensitive personal data could and should be stored on a Blockchain. Additionally, new regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that the EU has implemented, have much stricter laws that govern data retention and how personal data is shared. Supply Chain Some of the largest areas of opportunity can be found throughout a typical supply chain. Trust, as we all know, is usually earned. Historically, it s challenging for a large number of parties in a supply chain to agree on a common set of data. With Blockchain all the transactions are synchronized and any organization, with permission, can view the data and verify the transactions without unnecessary cross-checking. A recent survey of more than 500 procurement leaders from 39 countries found that the biggest problem they face in the supply chain is transparency. 65 of procurement leaders say they have no or limited visibility beyond their Tier 1 suppliers. This type of increased supply chain transparency and validation can also lead to the removal of many intermediaries that perform this type of work now. Consider all the fees and time delays that typically accompany delivering and tracking goods. For international ocean freight, customs clearance fees and time delays can result in waste and even spoilage of perishable food. Last year, Walmart ran a very successful proof of concept Blockchain test with one of their largest suppliers of pork in China. The product (bacon!) was successfully tracked from the processing plant, to the warehouse, to an ocean liner, to the port, through customs, onto a delivery truck and ultimately to Walmart s DC. Within the procure-to-pay lifecycle there are often large delays in payment processing between supplier invoice submission and payment. Sometimes this is intentional and yields positive cashflow benefits, but oftentimes a company is giving up early payment discounts (free money!). Blockchain can resolve this issue with the use of smart contracts. These contracts are software code that automates if this, then that scenarios on a Blockchain. Validation of goods receipts, matching an invoice to a purchase order and then payment automation per the desired payment terms. Audience questions at the end of the event were plentiful. A very encouraging as a sign of the general interest and growth potential for Blockchain. The market is still young and outside of the financial industry, we re mainly seeing proof of concept tests performed in other industry verticals. Larger full-scale adoption will be implemented this year by forward-thinking logistics and pharmaceutical providers. In our opinion, fortune will favor the bold early adopters of Blockchain technology. Interested in learning more from ProcureAbility experts?

    "text": "Robotic Process Automation for Procurement Every business has a desire to eliminate time-consuming, repetitive, but necessary, tasks. Robotic process automation (RPA) can improve processes and provide benefits like improved data accuracy, reduced costs, and increased output. While sophisticated automation tools like advanced AI are out of reach for most businesses, many can take advantage of robotic process automation to improve their procurement functions today. What is RPA? Masked behind a somewhat daunting name, robotic process automation is a piece of software that mimics human activities to carry out specific tasks within a process. It records the inputs of a user, and replicates those actions based on a set of rules, or as directed by a human. More advanced tech such as artificial intelligence or machine learning is not required for RPA; however, they can be combined to automate more complex tasks. RPA Benefits in Procurement The procurement function is full of processes that could be worthwhile candidates for a robotic process automation implementation. For example, this invoicing process that is done countless times daily: Open an email Open the attached invoice Uncover the relevant information Enter that data into an ERP These types of small repetitive tasks are both mundane and time-consuming. The ability to automate them can free up time for employees to spend on more involved or strategic initiatives. Some of the other benefits of RPA include: Cost reduction automated bots are able to work 24 7 and can perform tasks more efficiently and faster than a human. Error Elimination when implemented correctly, RPA is error-free, whereas a person may make a mistake due to distraction, fatigue, or multiple other factors. More accurate data software will never forget to update data sets, allowing for 100 accurate, real-time data. Improved employee productivity RPA allows employees to spend less time on repetitive tasks, and more time on value-adding activities and interacting with stakeholders. Implementing RPA When implementing RPA, start with processes that are impactful and easy to automate; high volume and error prone processes will benefit greatly from automation. Be sure to involve the IT team early and often, they can help collect resources required for an RPA implementation. Finally, depending on the scale of the RPA implementation, you may need to loop in HR to account for employees whose workflows and everyday processes are being disrupted. https: procureability.com robotic-process-automation-for-procurement",

Whether you re a Procurement leader who has implemented Category Management or are thinking about it, here are 5 simple truths about Category Management: Category Management is the most evolved Procurement strategy of the 3 common approaches (tactical, strategic sourcing, and category management) The simplest form of procurement is at the tactical purchasing stage executing orders (3 bids and a buy) Higher levels of strategy are employed at the Strategic Sourcing stage to capture more supplier value and to consolidate the supply base Category Management uses in-depth market insight to drive value to entire categories and evolves in real-time as the market changes Category Management is not a one-time implementation and then you re finished. It s a continuous evolution. Category Management is about continuous improvement of life cycle costing. It s a dynamic approach that requires proactive management and an evolution towards peak effectiveness, which is a moving target that changes with market dynamics. A deep understanding of the market place is required A key component of Category Management is deep knowledge of the marketplace. The Category Lead should develop a deep understanding of their categories and stay up-to-date on the latest developments so that the procurement approach can be optimized to the market s offerings. Category Management does not require hiring or implementing a Category Manager from the start Category Management evolves through an iterative process of categorization, category ownership, and eventually instituting formal roles. A Category Point of Contact can be assigned to start to manage a category as the transition to Category Management occurs. Procurement s primary role in Category Management is to guide the buyer (Business Unit) using a series of targeted questions By addressing the key questions about Demand and Forecast, Financial, Operational Requirements, and Quality, you ll have fulfilled your responsibility as the procurement advisor, having: Examined the historical purchasing patterns Addressed the key financial strategies Aligned with stakeholders on the distinct features and requirements necessary Set expectations for what quality looks like and how it should be delivered If well-executed, Category Management will produce far greater results for your procurement department and the organization than more elementary procurement approaches. A well-implemented Category Management structure will facilitate stakeholder alignment through the benefits of deep market knowledge. It will also enhance long-term vision and strategic planning through historic data tracking, bring visibility to progress through benchmarking, and motivate the workforce by developing expert knowledge in dynamic categories. https: procureability.com 5-simple-truths-about-category-management",

    "text": "Procurement Performance Metrics Why It s Important and How to Get Started As the need for procurement functions continue to grow, it is important to ensure your firm s procurement team evolves and keeps up with top industry performers using procurement performance metrics. Determining these metrics may seem daunting, but it does not need to be. Metrics should be chosen on a contextual basis and should excite the team, driving productivity levels to reach the metric goals. Here are 5 metrics to get you jumpstarted on growing your firm s procurement department: Maverick Spend: Maverick spend is traditionally defined as purchases made outside of agreed contracts, but the definition is flexible to the context of your company. For example, if your company struggles with a high rate of P-Card purchases, your definition of maverick spend could translate to P-Card purchases even though it is not outside of agreed contracts. Tracking any spend outside of controlled parameters will bring organization to your firm s spend patterns. Contract Compliance: Ever wondered how much effort your team puts into settling on an agreed contract with a supplier? Measuring contract compliance rate may be your answer. This metric can be personalized with 3-5 key contract terms that are the most important to your company. Once chosen, buyers or S2P systems can track the rate at which suppliers comply, giving insight into which suppliers are not readily accepting. Or, if the firm itself needs to reframe that specific contract term to keep up with industry norms. Customer Satisfaction: In the context of Procurement, customer satisfaction translates to the happiness of the firm s employees. Their happiness could depend on the rate at which they receive the requested products services, the procurement team s communication levels with customers, using the best suppliers, etc. A simple way to keep track of what aspects of procurement are most important to your customers is to conduct a semi-annual or annual survey including standard customer service questions. Use the customer responses to determine key satisfaction areas for your procurement team to focus on in the coming quarter. SCM Productivity: This metric measures the supply chain team s activity against top performing industry benchmarks. This could be defined as the number of procurement transactions managed by buyers, the procurement team s PO cycle time, PO accuracy and many others. The company and procurement team must decide which of these are critical to procurement success and continue tracking against the defined benchmark until the gap has been closed. This metric can be conducted in parallel to the customer satisfaction metric to determine high priority activities to be tracked. Procurement Savings: Traditionally defined as procurement led profit enhancing savings, tracking EBITDA is most often the best approach to measuring procurement savings. EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is a measure of a company s overall financial performance and is used as an alternative to simple earnings or net income in some circumstances. Simply put, EBITDA is a measure of profitability. EBITDA savings can be divided into the company s KPI s, e.g. savings by category, savings by type, etc. It is important to keep in mind that metrics should be fluid, grow with the team and scope, and regularly be reevaluated, at minimum, annually. https: procureability.com procurement-performance-metrics-why-its-important-and-how-to-get-started",

    "text": "Tips and Tricks to Negotiate Better He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation. Chris Voss As costs continue to rise and market competition intensifies, companies are constantly looking for creative ways to preserve margins. By relying heavily on data and advanced analytics, they re able to identify patterns in consumer behavior, market trends and in the competitive landscape. However, there s one concept that has stood the test of time: To sell well, you need to buy well. And to buy well, you must harness the power of negotiation. When it comes to negotiating, joined gains are possible when both sides give up something that is relatively unimportant to them, and in return, get something that is desired. Here are eight steps you should consider for a successful supplier negotiation: Get the facts right. Gather data from multiple sources and verify its accuracy. Design a process. Clearly define roles, levers, and desired outcomes. It is important to eliminate hidden agendas from negotiations. Plan extensively. There is no substitute for planning. Simulate questions and conversations that might occur during the negotiation process. Whichever party goes into a negotiation better prepared, will have the upper hand and usually comes out ahead. Know the other party s position. Not only should you understand why you re negotiating, but you must understand why your counterpart is negotiating. Negotiate in their world and create a path to your objective. Try to convince them that the outcome is their own idea. Collaborate. Consider win-win negotiations with a few select suppliers who allow you to leverage economies of scale. Treat them as partners, not an adversaries. Rank and prioritize your objectives. Remember to negotiate beyond unit price alone. Quality, performance, payment terms, and contract durations are all value levers. Don t be afraid to walk away. Negotiations aren t always successful. Preparing a contingency plan strengthens your position in the negotiation and helps you to avoid making an agreement that should be rejected. Familiarize yourself with BATNA (Best alternative to a negotiated agreement). Study the past. Negotiations are a continuous effort. It is likely that you will be dealing with suppliers over a long period of time. As such, establish a framework to objectively evaluate your performance in previous engagements and leverage lessons learned to conduct more efficient and productive negotiations in the future. Negotiating with suppliers doesn t have to be difficult, but it does pay to have a plan before you approach them. By using the tips above, you ll be well armed for your next supplier negotiation. https: procureability.com tips-and-tricks-to-negotiate-better",

    "text": "Vendor Relationship Management What Is It and Why It s Important Vendor relationship management most anyone in the practice of procurement has come across this concept, and for some, it s a focal point of their work. Vendor relationship management is exactly what it sounds like the managing of relationships with vendors, which, in today s world, is conducted heavily through software and the internet. When executed effectively, vendor relationship management can be the difference in simply performing business with a vendor and developing a longstanding strategic alliance for both companies to achieve an otherwise unachievable level of growth together. What Is It At its core, vendor relationship management encompasses thorough communication and collaboration to achieve a level of synchronicity between two parties. That synchronicity works to maintain optimal supply management, or in the case of service procurement, optimal execution of services performed. The most robust vendor relationships often include a high level of collaboration that can lead to the distinction between barebones offerings and hand-crafted solutions. Why it s Important Growth the saying goes that rising tides raise all ships that certainly rings true with vendor relationships. Though each side will always need to do what will be best for their own respective ends, the -more adversarial approaches utilized in the procurement of yester-years is not conducive to getting the most of a vendor relationship today. The strongest vendor relationships of today can be viewed more as partnerships or strategic alliances, where collaboration and sharing information are key drivers in mutually achieving success. Keys to Managing Vendor Relationships: Below are four major keys to effectively managing vendor relationships: Communication consistent correspondence, quality communication, personal relationships Collaboration sharing information, systems integration, operational transparency Technology as a part of the above-mentioned collaboration process, having vendor relationship management software and tools can help in areas such as: day-to-day order management, communication, tracking and metrics reporting. Strategize Measure Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) develop a strategy and roadmap for success. KPI establishment and subsequent measurement creates a foundation for your relationship s growth. Vendor relationship management practices can be a major difference-maker to companies that may not currently utilize such practices. Understanding these principals can benefit vendor relationships of any level, which in turn is in the best interest of your company. https: procureability.com vendor-relationship-management-what-is-it-and-why-its-important",

    "text": "Time to Implement Category Management? 3 Key Questions to Help You Decide Curious if your procurement organization is ready for Category Management? The following diagnostic questions will help you determine if a move to Category Management should be in your near-term plans: Supplier Visibility: Is visibility into your organization s suppliers fuzzy? In other words, do you have immediate access to real time data to answer the following questions: Who are the top 10 suppliers that support your organization in terms of spend and what is the total amount of spend with each? How many IT suppliers do you have? Which ones provide hardware? What about software? Which provide ongoing Professional Services versus one-time services? Do you have two or more suppliers that are direct competitors of each other? Who are they? Who are your Professional Services suppliers and do you know which ones provide Consulting Services versus Temporary Labor Services? Procurement Planning: Does your procurement organization focus on short-term procurement project planning? Or are there deep discussions with the business units about: long-term benefits and risks with suppliers, demand forecasts, supplier relationship building, and other long-term impacts when awarding contracts? Procurement Value: Is the value generated from negotiations and sourcing a one-time cost-savings or is there a long-term approach taken when a supplier is chosen? If the savings through negotiations and sourcing events are: Quickly lost due lack of supplier governance Or an opportunity to grow a more value producing relationship with a supplier is not realized the supplier relationship is merely transactional and limited in the value brings to the organization. If you re having trouble answering these questions, that s because you have a limited view of the categories of spend in your organization and the subsequent category strategies that would allow you to deliver continuous value improvements to your organization. Knowing the answers to these questions are important because they allow you to simplify demand, reduce costly redundancies, leverage volumes, centralize spend, increase spend under management, and help ensure the lowest possible prices for the best quality goods. All of the things are foundational to a top procurement organization! If you are leery about considering Category Management because it sounds like a huge undertaking, remember that it doesn t have to be a major disruption to your procurement organization. It can be implemented as a large, transformational project or it can be undertaken with an incremental approach. We ve discussed both approaches previously in 5 Simple Truths About Category Management and Category Management in Only 30 Days. https: procureability.com time-to-implement-category-management-3-key-questions-to-help-you-decide",

    "text": "Benefits of Supplier Diversity What is supplier diversity? While there isn t a national standard, examples of diverse suppliers include: minority-owned businesses certified by the department of general services, disabled veteran owned firms, LGTBQ owned enterprises or state certifications such as the California Public Utilities Commission for woman-owned companies. Certification may not always be required, but most large corporations prefer documentation to avoid fraudulence. How can it help your business? Drive competition Meet customer expectations Promote flexibility of services Improve process diversity Encourage local community economic development Boost employee retention and recruitment Growing Significance Supply chain transparency is becoming more important to consumers, causing it to become a marketing feature. Over the last decade, consumers have demanded more information about corporate supply chains and how products are sourced. Blockchain has also allowed for companies to be more transparent when sourcing products from other countries where supply chain issues have occurred. Using local suppliers helps keep money in the community along with supporting local jobs. A 2017 study by the Hackett Group revealed that companies with 20 or more spend with diverse suppliers can attribute up to 15 of their annual sales to their supplier diversity programs. Goal setting Supplier diversity metrics vary from industry to industry. Many companies strive for 8-12 of spend with diverse suppliers while other industries such as utilities can be as high as as 40 . The government has also been a big proponent of diverse spend with target rates between 20-30 . Reporting After setting goals, it is important to track results to see year over year trends. Companies like Walmart provide Global Responsibility Reports detailing their supply chain spend and responsibility. Soon, this may become common place or required since most companies have the data and investors have begun demanding access to the data. Once this occurs, tier 2 spending will be the next focus among corporations and investors.

    "text": "The Future of AI in Procurement: The transformative impact of generative AI Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the nature of work across almost every industry, around the globe. We see it in creative work, where large language and image AI models generate automated content. In manufacturing, generative AI augments human-based product design efforts, optimizing key processes, and improving quality control. It s changing how healthcare is delivered, improving patient outcomes through better diagnosis and information sharing. We have experienced many such use cases as we built tech-enabled procurement organizations for our clients. To deliver market-leading, AI-enabled solutions to our clients, ProcureAbility partnered with dSilo, a leading AI company and as we collaborated with many of our clients to understand their future vision for AI, we decided to synthesize our findings to present our co-authored Insights series, The Future of AI in Procurement . In the first installment of this series, The transformative impact of generative AI, we explore how game-changing AI can be to connecting strategic and tactical procurement processes while reducing manual activities significantly. We delve into the transformational potential of AI in procurement, and the unique traits making it a prime use case for AI adoption in our industry, to an extent that previously hasn t been possible. A function like no other Procurement faces unique challenges in an organization. It sits at the junction between external suppliers and other internal functions, making it the lynchpin of an ecosystem that provides the goods and services an organization needs to be competitive. Externally, supplier engagement can vary from a simple buy transaction for a generic item to a complex multi-year relationship ladened with forecasts, exchange of engineering drawings, delivery schedules, post-delivery services, warranty claims, and end-of-life management. Internally, procurement must remain aligned with its organization s short-term budget considerations and long-term planning needs. Daily, procurement is managing a highly variable set of processes that are needed to meet the requirements of these multiple stakeholders. Inevitably, this wide range of responsibilities leads to a patchwork of systems as procurement professionals strive to satisfy their stakeholder requirements and meet goals of ongoing cost savings and manage risk and compliance. If we think about current system landscape, almost every organization has implemented a foundational Procure-to-Pay (P2P) system, frequently driven by their enterprise resource planning (ERP) choice, and these have amounted to significant investments, especially with a shift to the cloud over the past decade. Typically, the P2P provider also offers a suite of procurement related modules, but these have often come through acquisitions and hence aren t well-integrated into the suite, which leads to adding on best-of-breed solutions that satisfy needs but at the same time create a patchwork of information silos. Because they are often addressing niche needs, it doesn t always make sense to integrate them with the foundation, or the ROI is insufficient for IT s effort. Bridging the gaps Enter generative AI, which can help procurement address these challenges in two major ways. 01 BRIDGING THE SYSTEMS CHASM It can close holes in the Swiss cheese patchwork of systems by enabling cost-efficient integration. For example, we have a customer that uses a P2P suite but is unable to reconcile legal invoices at a line-item level between the hourly rates charged on an invoice and the rate table agreed in the contract especially where in the past, they had to conduct manual spot audits, which they tacitly acknowledged failed to pick up every error. Today, that s no longer the case. Our generative AI platform reconciles all line items to the contractual terms and flag discrepancies. Additionally, generative AI can bridge gaps in payment terms specifically any variances between contract, invoice, and system defaults. For example, generative AI can reconcile the three data points and notify accounts payable in real-time, eliminating the possibility of any early payments and helping manage free cash flow. 02 SCALING BEYOND HUMAN CAPACITY The generative AI platform can execute at scale. It s not limited in capacity as a human is, although it can replicate the simple, repeatable steps a human would make. In another current client example, we have a case that spins off a business entity. The client needs to know which contracts have an Assignment Clause or equivalent, or Termination for Convenience. These clauses are typically not captured in a Contract Lifecycle Management tool s metadata field, and it s unrealistic for someone to review all documents to find such clauses. Many of our clients have used a platform solution to ingest thousands of documents and using semantic search, have categorized and extracted these clauses into dashboards that can then be filtered by category or geography. Now, for example, the client s IT Category Manager in Singapore can review the dashboards and identify which of their contracts don t have the desired clauses, so they can act with the supplier. This would not be possible without generative AI enabling analysis at scale. Deploying AI solutions As procurement collectively continues the journey with AI, there are steps you can take to engage and maximize your outcomes. Looking ahead In the second installment of our Future of AI in Procurement Insights series, Quick wins driven by the power of passive AI, we explore passive AI and how, along with generative AI, it can enhance the P2P process through examining various use cases including spend analysis, strategic sourcing, contract management, and invoice processing.

We see it in creative work, where large language and image AI models generate automated content. In manufacturing, generative AI augments human-based product design efforts, optimizing key processes, and improving quality control. For example, it s changing how healthcare is delivered, improving patient outcomes through better diagnosis and information sharing. To better understand AI s role in transforming the procurement landscape, ProcureAbility and our AI partner, dSilo, present our co-authored Insights series, The Future of AI in Procurement. In the fifth and final installment of this series, we re sharing our thoughts on where we see generative AI taking us in the long term and the implications for the procurement function. Current State We ve seen a significant evolution in the thinking around gen AI in a short amount of time. Topics business leaders now regularly debate include how quickly it will be deployed, the expected business impact, the ethical considerations, and the implications for humans and society at large. But few companies report experiencing a bottom-line boost from AI: a recent study found that only 15 percent of respondents were seeing a meaningful impact of Gen AI on their company s earnings before interest and taxes.¹ As business leaders gain more experience with AI, they re becoming more realistic and less susceptible to hype. This is not unlike major technological breakthroughs of the past: there s an inevitable adoption curve that takes time to build awareness of technology s potential, evaluate different approaches, and start to experiment with select opportunities. This process ultimately leads them to make more informed decisions about where to commit meaningful investment for practical applications. If history is any precedent, then the adoption curve gen AI should follow is a similar path, albeit on an accelerated timeframe. As you think about your own company s journey toward leveraging gen AI in procurement, we believe it s important to keep four rules of thumb in mind as you proceed into the future, so as not to stray too far afield and ensure gen AI is a genuine value-add for your organization: 1. Use Gen AI where it s differentiated As you look to develop use cases for deploying gen AI, consider where the technology has capabilities that are differentiated from what we humans can do best. For example, gen AI insights are based on what s happened in the past, so the technology can recognize patterns and flag insights as it looks at new data sets. At least at this point, humans are still better at dealing with new issues or exceptions that draw on a wider range of experiences than large language models have been trained in. Combining the strengths of humans and gen AI engines will get the best out of all your resources. 2. Transform from the bottom up Most of our current focus for experimentation with gen AI is on taking specific well-defined tasks and automating them. That s because this is an area where organizations are immediately able to evaluate technology options and implement practical applications. It s also a lot more manageable organizations can address each discrete task in an overall workflow and automate work task by task. This approach also fits well within an agile deployment model where each problem is broken down into small steps that can be solved in turn. Working from the bottom up and stringing together a slew of successes also helps teams build their Gen AI literacy through learning by doing, which can help reduce implementation risks down the road. 3. Build a vision from on high At the same time as you re automating and transforming individual tasks and knitting them together into the workflow, it s important to consider what it s all adding up to. Ask yourself, What could the future look like? In some cases, these kinds of top-down appraisals might point to a different path. Instead of simply improving what already exists, you might be better off reengineering the process altogether. Keep focusing on the ultimate outcomes you desire. You might find, for example, that instead of using gen AI to build category reports, pulling data from multiple sources, the better application might be using gen AI capabilities to structure and execute a direct negotiation with key suppliers, clearly articulating what you want to accomplish on price, service, and so on. The most important question should be: What steps do we take to fully automate commerce, where, for example, our legacy contracts can become smart contracts because all the transactional information has been extracted and embedded into P2P systems? 4. Keep the data clean The gen AI models function on data that s their oxygen, their fuel. But we know that the data we re working with in many cases isn t clean for various reasons meta data hasn t been captured; mechanisms for data updates, such as supplier information or lead time information, are ineffective; legacy data isn t pulled through when systems are upgraded. Using the technology to take the foundational step of cleaning up the data and eliminating errors and gaps is a long-term exercise, but essential to ultimately support the top-down strategy of automating commerce. For example, to update order lead times gen AI could request information from suppliers on a routine basis, and push responses into the P2P system. It s never too soon to work on data integrity. Remember, we ve been evolving in how we use the internet for business for more than two decades, and even software-as-a-service (SaaS) took time to gain traction and acceptance over that span. These experiences with breakthrough technology adoption have allowed us to mature and make better, more informed decisions as we now stand on the cusp of putting gen AI to use for maximum effect. Looking ahead Humans should always be at the center to position your organization for genuine transformation. Understand that humans will continue to be required to run the procurement function, to deal with new requirements and exceptions. Focus the gen AI roadmap on parts of the function such that the humans on the team can be more effective and more efficient. For example, enabling transactional execution, in compliance with policies, by guiding stakeholders to the optimal suppliers to meet each requirement, with streamlined requisitioning, ordering, receiving, and payment. Or completing the analysis required to develop a category strategy and build an RFP with the relevant data. Or doing the first pass redlining on a contract document, to support Legal reviews. This way humans can work strategically to drive value. In this Insights series, we explored the transformative role of generative AI in elevating procurement capabilities, with a focus on how ProcureAbility and dSilo are currently implementing these practices to take their clients use of this game-changing technology to the next level. This is truly an exciting, once-in-a-generation opportunity for procurement leaders to dramatically increase their contributions to their organizations success. Although gen AI has been a hot topic for a while, we re still in the first mile or two of what promises to be a marathon. It s important to be open to taking that first step on the road to the finish line by experimenting, learning, and evolving throughout the process.

    "text": "Mastering Managed Procurement Services Transforming Procurement Operations Part One As your business grows or adjusts to industry changes, scaling your procurement strategy quickly and efficiently is crucial. Yet, building a strong procurement function often requires resources that many companies lack. This is where Managed Services can step in and leverage specialized teams to support your needs. Managed Services entails engaging an external party to help oversee procurement. The agreement enables the provider to execute procurement processes. This type of support can result in immediate and effective advantages, enhancing your overall procurement function. To better understand Managed Services role in driving business growth, ProcureAbility is presenting its Insights series, Mastering Managed Procurement Services. We ll lend our expertise to help your procurement service organization navigate this growing service offering. We ll also provide a comprehensive introduction to the world of procurement Managed Services, exploring its core competencies, components, and pivotal role in your procurement success strategy and long-term growth in 2024 and beyond. How do third-party service providers integrate with your procurement team? Effective service providers function as strategic partners to a company s procurement team. They seamlessly integrate by understanding needs, goals, and strategies, aligning their services offerings with broader business objectives. This ensures that the revamped procurement process supports strategic goals throughout the organization. A strong partnership helps reach organizational goals through teamwork, clear communication, transparency, ongoing improvement, and shared values. By executing effectively, external Managed Services partners add value to the organization by improving important processes such as purchasing standards and introducing innovative concepts. What are the different types of engagement models? In the ever-changing world of procurement, customized and bespoke solutions are essential. As organizations grow more complex, flexible engagement models have emerged. These models customize procurement services to match each organization s specific needs and goals to drive change effectively. Examples of leading engagement models include: Functional design model Ad-hoc resource model Category-based resource model A functional design model offers flexibility by letting companies choose which parts of the procurement cycle to keep in-house and which to seek the expertise of a Managed Services partner. It enables organizations to keep control of processes that may be more sensitive due to risk, knowledge, or cultural factors. Allows businesses to strategically determine how best to manage, internally or externally, operational processes such as Requisition to Purchase Orders or Contract Creation and Administration and retain Category Management or Contract Negotiation for high-dollar categories. The functional design model allows for the organization to focus on core business areas including Sales, Marketing, or Customer Service, by enlisting the help of a managed services partner for the complete end-to-end procurement process across all categories. An ad-hoc resource model enables organizations to quickly adjust their procurement support in response to specific needs, providing a rapid response to business needs and project-based, unique skill sets. The ad-hoc resource design allows organizations to easily adjust for shifting business conditions, such as M A activity or peak seasonal demands or projects. Alternatively, it also allows for a quick dialing down, and controlling the costs the organization incurs, in response to a slowdown in business. This engagement model is designed to engage a procurement services provider to manage select categories by supporting end-to-end procurement activities within the categories. The client and the procurement services provider jointly set objectives, SLAs, and KPIs for the category, which can be monitored through a robust governance framework. For example: Assigning the complete or partial portfolio of Indirect categories to the service provider to manage and be accountable for all end-end activities such as category strategy development and management, execution of sourcing (RFx) projects, commercial and contract negotiations, and managing operational procurement activities like PR to PO processing and supplier onboarding. What key challenges do Managed Services Providers help to solve? Procurement Managed Services providers have expert market knowledge, access to the best tools, and established industry connections. This enables a service provider to function as an agile partner, quickly resolving complex business processes and issues. Insufficient capacity Sometimes, daily transactional activities take precedence over important strategic activities such as category planning. Procurement service providers are valuable partners in saving time, as they specialize in streamlining procurement processes efficiently. Companies can shorten procurement times by using a service provider s knowledge and tools to help them meet and exceed deadlines more effectively. Resource constraints A procurement services provider optimizes the use of available resources, unlocking access to a broader network of suppliers and procurement technologies. This allows businesses to stretch their capabilities further than they could independently. Expertise Procurement Managed Services providers bring knowledge that organizations may lack and are able to leverage immediately. For example, these providers possess valuable negotiation skills and category market intelligence that can be immediately leveraged by organizations in their upcoming negotiations. Talent Gaps Aligning with a procurement service provider offers the unique benefit of being able to quickly address gaps in a company s infrastructure. A procurement partner can act fast to solve many of the common issues facing an organization, such as: Innovation Managed Services providers bring fresh perspectives and cutting-edge solutions, fostering innovation within procurement and enhancing business value. Expertise Procurement experts provide valuable insights to resolve issues and enhance procurement processes effectively. Capacity Procurement teams recruit top talent to address organizational gaps and seize new opportunities. Transparency An external service provider can develop and report key performance indicators (KPIs) and increase the visibility of projects through real-time data and service levels reporting. Critical Advantages of Managed Services: Enhancing efficiency and boosting profitability Implementing a Managed Services strategy provides benefits beyond immediate problem-solving. Partnering with a procurement service provider helps to drive benefits to the bottom line by analyzing procurement processes and eliminating unnecessary time and spend. These benefits include: Improving operational efficiency A procurement services provider brings experience, best practices, and innovation to streamline procurement. From automating tasks to optimizing supplier relationships, service providers transform procurement into a lean, agile operation. This creates a more focused and efficient procurement organization that can quickly adapt to today s fast-paced business world. Reducing financial waste Businesses can save money by using service providers strategic knowledge and buying power. This means lower costs, better supplier deals, and fewer mistakes in procurement. Efficient strategic sourcing and spending management strategies ensure that every dollar spent contributes to the company s growth, directly impacting the bottom line. Partnering with a procurement Managed Services provider offers several unique benefits that can enhance ROI and streamline procurement processes. An efficient procurement system can positively impact the entire client organization and propel the business forward.

    "text": "Part TwoMastering ManagedProcurement ServicesThe Five Rules of Engagement Listen to this article 11 min To improve the understanding of how Managed Services can help support business growth, ProcureAbility is presenting Mastering Managed Procurement Services. In this Insights series, we provide a comprehensive introduction to procurement Managed Services, exploring how this model supports procurement success and long-term growth. In the first installment of this series, we delved into how a procurement Managed Services provider can help you transform your operations. In this second part, we conclude the series by providing a five-step, actionable roadmap to help you think through where to start and how to effectively develop your relationship with a Managed Services provider. Maximizing your partnership with a procurement Managed Services provider requires a strategic approach to defining their role within your organization. You should start by developing clear objectives and an understanding of how your organization could utilize and benefit from such a partnership, what qualities and capabilities your provider should have, what types of engagements might be best to start with, and how your relationship may evolve over time. The following five steps provide a roadmap to an optimal Managed Services provider partnership. 1. Develop your organizational requirements Effective service providers function as strategic partners to a company s procurement team. They seamlessly integrate by understanding needs, goals, and strategies, aligning their services offerings with broader business objectives. This ensures that the revamped procurement process supports strategic goals throughout the organization. A strong partnership helps reach organizational goals through teamwork, clear communication, transparency, ongoing improvement, and shared values. By executing effectively, external Managed Services partners add value to the organization by improving important processes such as purchasing standards and introducing innovative concepts. Questions to consider at this formative stage include: How well is your procurement organization meeting its objectives and goals? How effective is procurement in partnering with business teams to help meet their objectives? What are the gaps, constraints, and inefficiencies in the processes and operating model of your procurement team that may be prohibiting it from being more effective? Is your procurement team being strategic in their engagement and approach as they partner with business teams? Does your team have the appropriate resources, technology enablers, business engagement model, knowledge, and time to play a strategic role? What specific areas do you need support in from a Managed Services provider to get most value in making your team more effective? What specific outcomes or improvements are you and your business stakeholders looking for from this partnership? What information about your organization, objectives, scope, work volumes and challenges should you share with Managed Services providers for them to offer you a well-thought-out solution? 2. Conduct due diligence of potential partners A good fit between your company and your Managed Services provider is the foundation of a successful partnership. Prior to onboarding a Managed Services provider, it s essential to conduct an in-depth evaluation of their services, ensuring alignment with your business objectives and culture. The right partner will improve your procurement operations and ROI, but a mismatched partnership can create challenges such as missed goals, ineffective communication, missed opportunities, cultural friction, unhappy stakeholders, and even risk and compliance issues. When beginning your search for a Managed Services provider, start with the most essential criteria for your business: Functional expertise: The provider s functional or domain knowledge and experience in procurement services is the most critical criteria to consider when choosing a partner. As you evaluate the service provider on this criterion, delve into specific areas of expertise. For example, if the scope you are considering is source to contract execution support focus on understanding the providers knowledge and experience in conducting RFPs RFQs, commercial and contract negotiations including process and methodologies they use and the client programs they have supported with these specific services. Talent: An organization is only as good as its people. Be sure that the potential Managed Services provider offers experienced procurement professionals with the right level of skills and knowledge. Ideal professionals not only have strong process and execution capabilities but bring a strategic perspective to the projects and processes supported. Beyond procurement knowledge also learn about how the provider manages their talent s knowledge and career growth as this will impact the quality of services and consistency on the team assigned to your operation. Industry alignment: Finding a Managed Services provider with a proven record in your industry is vital for harnessing the full advantages of the partnership. This ensures your chosen external partner is knowledgeable about your industry s nuances while also being able to offer tailored solutions that drive significant value to your operations. Scalability and flexibility: Selecting a procurement service provider that can seamlessly adapt and scale up or down according to your company s evolving needs is also essential. For long-term success, select a Managed Services provider capable of adapting as your business evolves. Technology: Evaluate whether the provider is not just familiar with but is actively integrating the latest procurement technologies. Their commitment to leveraging innovative tools is a good indicator of their ability to optimize your procurement operations effectively. Your provider should be familiar with operating within your technology stack, and ideally agnostic and flexible to utilize any technology platforms. Processes: Be sure to partner with a provider with a case history of improving organizations by adjusting their procurement processes. This experience will enable them to deploy improvements to optimize your procurement process. Service footprint: A Managed Services provider with a broad service footprint can provide nuanced support that aligns with your geographical and market-specific requirements, ensuring that your procurement strategies are both globally informed and locally applicable. Market intelligence: The ability to tap into up-to-date, relevant market data and trends can give your procurement strategies a competitive edge. Evaluate how a Managed Services provider gathers, analyzes, and utilizes market intelligence to inform procurement decisions and strategies. 3. Choose the area of engagement The right area of engagement of procurement managed services depends on your organizational maturity. A mature organization can benefit from offshore or a hybrid support model to lower costs, or from focusing on further enhancing procurement s value to the organization via global strategic sourcing, category, or analytical support. A younger organization can get the most out of their Managed Services provider by jointly establishing procurement policies, processes, augmenting their source-contract execution and procurement operations teams and supply of needed key category knowledge. As you consider the right areas to engage, think about initiating support in these impactful areas: Source-to-contract (S2C) execution, operational procurement (PR to PO) activities, spend analytics and value reporting, category management support. Streamlining and managing the source-to-contract process: Your provider can improve the S2C process execution by speeding up the selection, evaluation, award, and engagement process while staying compliant with policy and contractual requirements. Optimizing and managing the procurement requisition to purchase order process: Tackling this operational process brings value to the organization and improves the service level to the business stakeholders by changing the perception on the ease and time to process their purchase requisition. Strengthening spend analysis and value reporting: Using advanced analytics, your provider can identify spending patterns and categorize procurement activities, enabling you to focus the investment and energy on the most impactful areas. Also, reporting on Procurement metrics such as savings or cost avoidance, cycle-times, customer satisfaction, and other business impacts can help show Procurement s true value to the organization. Category management support: Your category managers may benefit from support with supply market research, analysis of current supply base and planning of sourcing and other improvement projects to manage their categories more effectively. 4. Consider leveraging strategic project support In addition to identifying the core areas to be supported by your provider, consider whether they can deliver more value via support for large-scale highly visible strategic projects. Often the provider can leverage their experience, expertise, and efficiency to help identify and deliver high impact for your strategic projects initiatives. Areas to consider include: Strategic sourcing initiatives: Your provider can often play a more strategic role by supporting the development and execution of strategic sourcing plans and category strategies that align with the company s long-term goals. Supplier relationship management: Bringing their specialized industry expertise, your provider can enhance relationships with your organization s key suppliers to foster collaboration, innovation, and value creation. Navigating organizational changes: Managed Services providers are often experts in smooth transitions and change management. From M A to reorganizations, or shifting procurement processes, your procurement partner can guide your procurement team through strategic procurement initiatives while ensuring stakeholder buy-in and seamless transitions. 5. Plan for cultural integration, communication, and change management Cultural alignment is key to integrating managed procurement services successfully. Without that awareness, an effective collaboration can prove elusive. But you ll need to do your part in bringing your provider up to speed in this respect, which you can do through the following steps: Communicate your organization s values: This knowledge and cultural context will enable the provider to develop procurement strategies that align with the company s goals. For example, if ESG is a priority for your organization, your provider can work to identify eco-friendly suppliers. Explain the ways you work best: Provide your provider with information about the company s communication style, decision-making process, organizational culture, to facilitate effective collaboration. Communication to key stakeholder groups and establishing new ways of working: Engage stakeholder groups, such as key business units, Legal, Risk Management, Finance, IT Security, etc., with whom your managed services provider will be interacting on a regular basis on projects. It is important to establish standard rules of engagement and processes, regular touchpoints, and communication expectations to ensure seamless interactions and hand-offs for successful execution of projects. Plan for an open, two-way communication channel: Establish clear channels of communication to bring teams leadership in alignment from the start. Initial implementation phase requires an open two-way communication to support adjustments in the program execution as well as distribution of new knowledge to and from your provider. Looking ahead Effectively leveraging a Managed Services partner accelerates onboarding and maximizes ROI. Gathering key information, deploying resources efficiently, and equipping teams with the right tools are crucial to maximizing procurement partnerships and driving value, efficiency, and innovation.

This strategy not only increases the chances of attracting the right candidates, but also ensures long-term retention and a positive work environment. Below are focus areas that have been shown to lead to greater candidate experience and employee retainment.

Highlighting the company s opportunities for growth and development, such as mentoring programs, training, continuing education benefits, and networking.

    "text": "Future of Procurement Talent Developing your procurement team from the inside out In today s fast-paced environment, upskilling your procurement team is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge. As a procurement leader, you need to understand industry trends to train your procurement team and empower them to drive innovative solutions, deliver unparalleled value, and become strategic partners in your business growth. To stay ahead of the curve you must learn, adapt, and evolve. The success of any organization relies heavily on its procurement team s strategic approach to efficient procurement and sourcing practices. Over time, business leaders have increasingly turned to procurement not just to acquire products and services but for insights that inform strategy as well. As procurement teams have gained greater visibility within their organizations, they have had to adapt the tools, capabilities, and mindset required to enhance their value. This transformation has been driven in part by emerging technology, resulting in the formation of hybrid procurement teams that combine experienced professionals with younger, tech-oriented individuals. In the first installment of ProcureAbility s Future of Procurement Insights series, we explored leading strategies for recruiting top talent to meet the demands of the procurement department. In this second installment, we delve into what it takes for procurement leaders to build successful teams from within, focusing on their internal dynamics and strategies. Start with a solid foundation Whether your procurement team consists of experienced professionals or young employees launching their careers, they all require additional development of skills. This requires fostering a team culture that emphasizes continuous improvement, innovation, and cross-functional collaboration. Motivate your team to stay updated on industry trends, enhance their negotiation skills, and cultivate strong supplier relationships. Your team needs clear guidance and a solid foundation for success. In today s evolving operational landscape, this translates to: Defining clear objectives by outlining your procurement department responsibilities and goals with the organization s strategic vision, to provide a clear sense of purpose and direction for team members. For example, what are your organization s goals around supplier diversity and risk management? Developing a structured team composition based on your organization s procurement needs, considering roles such as sourcing specialists, category managers, procurement analysts, and supplier relationship managers, ensuring a balance of skills and expertise. Implementing clear processes and workflows to streamline operations and ensure consistency, including clear documentation of sourcing strategies, supplier evaluations, and contract management procedures. Providing new procurement technology and tools to enhance efficiency and accuracy, including the latest procurement software that can automate processes, facilitate data analytics, and improve decision-making. This could include the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for demand forecasting and data analytics for supplier performance evaluation1. Building strong supplier relationships by emphasizing collaboration, mutual growth, and innovation elements that generate better supplier performance, reduce risks, and increase value2. Training and development With these enablers on hand, the next ingredient for success is ensuring your team s skills and capabilities remain not only relevant but differentiated as well. A well-trained procurement team is better equipped to navigate the complexities of global supply chains and risk management. That kind of training and development takes focus and dedicated resources. Identify existing skills and capability gaps, looking at areas such as negotiation, market analysis, contract management, and supplier relationships. What are your team s strengths? What skills are underrepresented? Where could you build a deeper bench? Provide training and development opportunities to enhance skills by investing in workshops, webinars, conferences, certification programs, and employee learning budgets to help your team advance their knowledge in specific areas. Leverage industry-recognized certifications through third-party service providers or organizations such as ISM3, Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM), and Chartered Institute of Procurement Supply (CIPS), whose qualifications enhance professional credibility and open doors to advanced roles4. Partner with an external entity for training and development of your team. Such partnerships often bring forth industry experts with a fresh, external perspective and specialized knowledge that can enhance the skills of the procurement team. These partners typically have a wide range of proven methodologies, tools, and techniques that have been successfully implemented in diverse industries, which can be tailored to the organization s unique need. Continue to provide training opportunities on an ongoing basis, keeping your team updated with industry trends, best practices, and emerging technologies. Continuous learning and development foster employee engagement and retention, thereby contributing to the overall growth and success of your organization. Focus on building out the right kind of culture Strong culture and leadership are essential to your procurement organization s cohesiveness and ensures clear communication and alignment with your organizational goals. You can start building the right kind of culture today by considering the following best practices: Support cross-collaboration with other departments like finance, legal, and operations to create mentorship opportunities and infuse procurement strategies across the organization. Create a culture of continuous improvement where team members are encouraged to seek innovative solutions, learn from mistakes, and contribute ideas for process enhancements. Encourage your team to regularly review and refine processes and seek feedback from internal stakeholders and suppliers to drive ongoing enhancements. Implement a recognition and reward system that acknowledges exceptional performance, providing motivation and supporting job satisfaction among team members. Establish clear performance metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of procurement initiatives. Prioritize employee well-being by promoting work-life balance, flexible work arrangements, and mental health support. Put your procurement recruiting process under the microscope When it comes to building a world-class procurement team, it s likely you ll need to bring in outside talent even as you look to develop your team internally. Reflect on your previous recruitment efforts: Did you successfully compete for qualified candidates? Why or why not? Are you able to identify the most successful new hires and the qualities they possess? The improvements you make from the recommendations above will surely help attract the right people. Recruiting people with a specific culture in mind, for example, will help drive the kind of change you want within your organization. Finding the right partner is essential to ensuring you have the resources and insights to build a world-class procurement team. ProcureAbility brings the expertise and experience needed to help you train and develop your team s talent, build a strong and resilient culture, and analyze your recruiting process. By strategically addressing the aspects above and collaborating with outside experts, you can create a procurement organization structure that is well-equipped from top to bottom, aligned with your organization s objectives, and primed for sustainable, long-term success. In part three of ProcureAbility s Future of Procurement Talent Insights series, we will explore effective strategies and best practices for retaining top procurement talent, through creating a supporting work environment that boosts job satisfaction, engagement, and long-term commitment.

    "text": "Future of Procurement Talent Strengthening employee retention Forget build it and they will come How about invest in it and they will stay ? In the competitive world of procurement, retaining top talent is vital for organizational success. Your procurement organization plays a crucial role in driving cost efficiency, fostering supplier collaboration, and promoting innovation. High turnover of procurement talent can undermine those benefits and lead to increased costs from recruitment, training, and lost productivity. Losing top talent can also disrupt supplier relationships and impede long-term procurement strategies. By implementing strategies that prioritize career development, recognition, work-life balance, and professional growth, organizations can cultivate an environment where procurement professionals thrive. The outcome is a cohesive, skilled, and dedicated procurement team that significantly contributes to your organization s strategic objectives and could provide you with substantial savings in solvable turnover. In this Future of Procurement Talent Insights series, we expand on the concepts shared in ProcureAbility s Five Bold Procurement Predictions for 2030. In the first and second installments of the talent series, we explored leading strategies for recruiting top talent and developing your internal procurement teams. In this blog, we will explore strategies and best practices for increasing your employees job satisfaction, engagement, and long-term commitment. Chief causes and impacts of turnover On average, US businesses lose nearly one in every four employees over a year. Each one of those voluntary departures comes with a cost. While the numbers fluctuate widely based on seniority, replacing a worker generally costs a business a third of their annual salary, according to Employee Benefits News. To effectively address these outflows, it is crucial to first uncover the underlying reasons behind the turnover within your procurement team. Failing to pinpoint these causes makes it significantly more challenging to develop strategies that will drive positive change in the desired direction. Neglecting these crucial areas can result in increased recruitment costs, decreased revenue, diminished employee morale, and the loss of institutional knowledge, especially if your organization experiences high turnover rates among your more seasoned staff. 10 steps to reduce and prevent procurement talent turnover Regularly assessing employee turnover rates, engagement levels, and soliciting feedback from your current procurement team can provide invaluable insights into their overall satisfaction and areas for improvement. Conducting surveys, one-on-one interviews, and organizing focus groups with team members enables you to analyze trends and identify patterns that unveil common reasons for departure, allowing you to address the underlying issues effectively. Training your people managers to take an active interest in their direct reports and serve as both a mentor and advocate can help to retain top performers. While this as good a place to start as any, we have found that procurement organizations can take additional steps at every point along an employee s career continuum to make sure they re the right fit, are adequately motivated and developed, and are made to feel like they re positive contributors not just to their organization s overall success but to society at large as well. Here are 10 best practices procurement leaders should keep in mind when it comes to boosting their workforce retention: 1. Hire the right people Reduce or avoid employee turnover by making sure you are hiring the right people for your team. Take the time to thoroughly vet candidates and ensure they align with your company s values, goals, and culture. This will not only help you retain employees, but also create a cohesive and productive team. 2. Establish clear career paths Provide transparent career paths by outlining potential roles, responsibilities, and qualifications required for advancement within your procurement team. 3. Provide opportunities for career advancement Offer continuous training and development opportunities to improve your procurement teams skill sets. Encourage your team to attend workshops, seminars, and obtain certifications to stay updated on industry trends, such as ISM, Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM), and Chartered Institute of Procurement Supply (CIPS). 4. Offer competitive compensation and benefits Compensate employees well, since competitive wages and benefits can boost employee loyalty and encourage them to stay longer in your organization. 5. Provide consistent and relevant feedback Conduct performance evaluations that are meaningful and provide coaching, obtainable goals, and career aspirations discussions. These evaluations will promote a culture of open communication and individual growth. 6. Prioritize work-life balance Offer flexible work hours, remote work options, and family-friendly policies that promote work-life balance and reduce burnout. 7. Creative a supportive work environment Establish a mentorship program by pairing experienced professionals with newer team members to facilitate knowledge transfer and personal growth. 8. Develop a strong work culture Cultivate a supportive and inclusive culture that aligns with your company s and procurement department s values and promotes a sense of belonging. 9. Demonstrate your company impact Highlight to your organization the positive impact procurement has on the organization s overall goals, sustainability, and social responsibility. 10. Conduct exit interviews Hold exit interviews to better understand why employees are leaving your company. These conversations with departing employees can provide valuable insights into any issues or concerns within the organization that may be contributing to turnover. Use this information to make necessary improvements and prevent future turnovers. Become an employer of choice A career in procurement offers unique benefits, diverse opportunities, and robust avenues for professional development. These factors collectively make it an attractive field for individuals seeking growth and impact in their careers. But employees have choices, and you need to do what you can to ensure your organization shines above the rest when it comes to providing both opportunity and fulfillment. By maintaining an ongoing feedback loop, organizations can fine-tune their retention approaches, implement timely interventions, and foster a culture of continuous improvement that keeps everyone rowing toward the same horizon. In our final blog of this Insights series, we will provide insights into what the future of procurement staffing looks like by 2030.

    "text": "Future of Procurement Talent Practices to take staffing and recruiting into the next decade Predicting the precise makeup of the procurement workforce in 2030 poses a challenge due to the intricate interplay of economic, technological, social, and regulatory factors. In the first, second, and third installments of the Future of Procurement Talent series, we explored leading strategies for recruiting top talent, developing your internal teams, and retaining top procurement talent. In this Insights blog, we close out this talent series by exploring strategies and best practices for increasing employees job satisfaction, engagement, and long-term commitment; and outline the evolving landscape of procurement talent trends and explore strategies and best practices to attract, develop, and retain top talent now and into the year 2030. Attracting top procurement and supply chain talent in an evolving landscape By 2030, recruitment is expected to heavily leverage technology, utilizing AI and data analytics to match candidates with job roles based on skills, cultural fit, and career aspirations.1 This approach aims to create more personalized and efficient recruitment experiences. AI s role extends to optimizing resource allocation through the analysis of historical data and demand patterns. Candidate experiences will be highly personalized, with AI tailoring job recommendations, interview processes, and onboarding materials to align with individual preferences and skills. Automation in talent acquisition 92 of Talent executives plan to expand their use of automation tools in at least one area of talent acquisition and workforce management.2 To bridge the skill gaps caused by the rapid growth of AI, talent acquisition leaders must explore the potential of AI-powered tools to automate their internal processes. These innovations can streamline various aspects of the recruitment journey, such as resume screening and interview scheduling.3 AI-powered technology enables the sourcing, screening, sorting, and ranking of candidates, creating a pool of qualified talent with the necessary skills for high-priority roles. Talent acquisition leaders can then compare these potential hires with internal candidates identified through their talent marketplace, a platform that leverages AI to match employees with suitable opportunities based on their skills and career aspirations. Data-driven HR 80 of Talent leaders predict that they will use talent data to drive decisions over the next five years.4 Data-driven HR strategies in procurement can optimize workforce management, align talent with business needs, and improve performance. By analyzing employee data, HR teams can identify areas for improvement and offer targeted training. Data analytics also inform recruitment decisions, sourcing channels, and candidate fit. This approach enhances retention with personalized development plans and career paths. Predictive analytics is also prepped to be a strong tool, as it can analyze historical data to predict future trends, such as talent demand across different markets and industries. Employer branding The future of employer branding will find its foundation in purpose, values, and tech-driven experiences. Job seekers will be drawn to organizations aligning with their values, emphasizing meaningful work and holistic well-being. Transparent, empathetic, and collaborative leadership styles will define employer branding. The incorporation of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) experiences may become commonplace, offering candidates immersive glimpses into a company s culture, environment, and projects. Remote work and global teams 32.6 million Americans will work remote by 2025 57 of Employees would look for a new job if their current company did not allow remote work 98 of workers want to work remote at least some of the time By 2025, 32.6 million Americans will work remote by 2025. More so, the sentiment is that 57 of workers would look for a new job if their current company did not allow remote work, and 98 of workers want to work remote at least some of the time.5 With the growth of remote work, talent pools have become globally dispersed, encouraging the need for procurement talent leaders in the global workforce planning model. As remote work continues to be prevalent; organizations will emphasize their approach to a remote and hybrid approach, highlighting flexibility and work-life balance. Companies will focus on creating engaging remote onboarding experiences that seamlessly integrate new employees into the company culture and allow them to feel connected to their colleagues. Diversity and inclusion Diversity and inclusion initiatives will take a significant role, fostering a more diverse and inclusive workforce. The rise of remote work has paved the way to global inclusion. Procurement teams will feature diverse professionals from various geographical locations, promoting cross-cultural perspectives, and expanding market reach. Talent leaders can help foster collaboration in a diverse workplace and encourage diverse perspectives, to help with innovation and decision making, by promoting virtual team-building activities or internal organizational groups. As AI continues to rise, DEI will play a crucial role in mitigating biases in algorithms. Although there are several ways in which AI can be used to improve workplace diversity through performance management processes, bias detection in discrimination and content, AI applications need to be carefully monitored and tested for fairness, risk mitigation and the ability to exacerbate biases. Procurement leaders will need to be mindful to not let the ease of using AI, override the human element of talent related decision making.6 Gig economy integration Organizations will leverage freelance experts for specialized projects, providing flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Embrace the gig economy by hiring expert consultants or freelancers for specialized tasks: This provides flexibility and cost savings as these workers are paid per task, without the additional benefits associated with full-time employees.7 Employee development and retention Looking ahead to 2030, procurement will see considerable influence from advanced technologies such as AI, machine learning, and automation. Procurement professionals will need to be adept at utilizing data analytics tools to make informed decisions, predict market trends, and optimize supplier relationships. The integration of AI and technology into procurement processes will have significant implications on procurement staffing, role structure, skill requirements, and overall efficiency.8 Additionally, the inclusion of comprehensive continued learning programs and employee resource will be a key factor behind an employer s ability to retain top procurement talent.9 71 of employees say job training increased satisfaction, and 61 listed upskilling as a motivation to keep employment.10 Continuous learning and upskilling due to technology shifts The procurement role is constantly evolving due to both skill requirements stemming from the shifting technology landscape, as well as the shifting priorities of the CPO. 98 of procurement decision leaders said they are planning investments in AI, analytics and insights tools, and automation for their procurement function over the next couple of years.11 Additionally, the rise of automated tasks will reduce the need for manual work, freeing up labor needed for routine, manual tasks. As the role of technology continues to transform procurement and supply chain, Procurement professionals will require a blend of technical and soft skills, including data analysis, AI utilization, negotiation, emotional intelligence, and cross-functional collaboration. Staff with data interpretation and analysis skills will be in high demand, creating new roles such as AI procurement analysts, digital procurement specialists, and technology integration managers. Upskilling due to evolving role of CPO and shifting priorities As the CPO role continues to evolve against the background of a challenging procurement environment, their expanding influence on the top priorities will also play a key role in the required skill sets needed within the procurement organization. The ProcureAbility-sponsored Annual 2024 ProcureCon CPO Report established that the top three focus areas for the CPOs in the next 12 months include process improvements, technology implementation and transformation as well as supply chain disruption.12 Expanding on AI initiatives and Delivering on ESG and sustainability goals were also key focus areas. These new priorities will determine what skillsets procurements talent leaders will look for, thus influencing the focal areas of procurement practitioners continued education. Shifting priorities from tactical to strategic Procurement continues to go through a transformative evolution as it delivers greater value for the organization and earns a strategic seat at the table. Procurement s role will shift from transactional to strategic, actively contributing to business strategy and driving innovation within the supply chain.13 Supplier relationship management As the importance of supplier collaboration grows, procurement professionals will excel in managing strategic supplier relationships, co-innovating, and ensuring sustainable practices across the supply chain. Sustainability and ethical sourcing With growing emphasis on sustainability and ethical sourcing, procurement teams will play a vital role in ensuring responsible procurement practices, minimizing environmental impact, and adhering to social responsibility standards. Companies that demonstrate a strong commitment to sustainability, diversity, and community engagement will attract and retain top talent. Data privacy and security Procurement professionals will play a crucial role in ensuring robust data privacy and security measures, especially with the increasing use of digital platforms and data-driven decision-making. 44 of executives report that the increased use of suppliers and partners exposes the company to more security threats.14 That places the onus for (at least part of) data security efforts squarely on the Chief Procurement Officer. Due to this emerging need, new roles will emerge; some businesses may appoint cybersecurity category leads with duties spanning information technology and procurement. Additionally, new training requirements will be necessary to meet the need for cyber security-related category expertise. The future of procurement staffing and recruiting in 2030 will be shaped by technological advancements, strategic priorities, and evolving workforce dynamics.

    "text": "Bold Procurement Predictions for 2030: Methodology As we stand at the cusp of a new decade, the procurement industry is rapidly evolving with a vast array of technological solutions aimed at streamlining processes within organizations. The abundance of tools and services available to Chief Procurement Officers may seem overwhelming, but the procurement field is actively embracing innovation and change. Those who fail to adapt risk being left behind in this transformative era. To better understand and navigate these developments, ProcureAbility is delighted to present its Bold Procurement Predictions for 2030 Insights series, providing insight into the new practices that are likely to become prevalent by 2030. The methodology ProcureAbility s approach to developing its predictions took some effort and coordination. ProcureAbility assembled a team of experts to work on the problem, develop hypotheses, and offer thoughtful insights on emerging trends. They examined where the field is and where it is going in the near term and in the next decade. ProcureAbility tested each hypothesis using qualitative and quantitative methods. They accepted input from an array of respected professionals in the procurement space. Team formation ProcureAbility assembled a working team of experts from various industries and specialties in the supply chain field to provide perspective and input. Topic definition Based on observation of the current state of the field and emerging trends the team hypothesized what the future state of procurement might look like in coming years. Data collection The team conducted in-depth qualitative and quantitative research to validate their hypotheses. Analysis Once the team had a data pool of significant size, they examined the information and drew reasonable conclusions that became the raw, bold predictions for the future of procurement. Validation With a working set of predictions, the team surveyed respected Chief Procurement Officers to validate (or invalidate) the predictions and rank them by degree of boldness . Ideating new procurement practices During the formation of the Bold Procurement Predictions for 2030 insights Series, ProcureAbility focused on procurement teams maturity levels for accepting new practices and emerging trends. It quickly became clear that procurement organizations greatly vary regarding the new processes and technologies adopted. Some are still mired in their core practices, while a small group of innovators are ideating new ways to leverage supply chain technology. As a result, the focus of ProcureAbility s effort was at the very top of the pyramid below: ideation. The predictions In upcoming editions, ProcureAbility will explore five emerging trends that procurement organizations should anticipate will transition from the top of that pyramid to the bottom by 2030. These concepts, which may currently seem futuristic, will eventually become a standard accepted practice within the procurement field by 2030. Advanced crowdsourcing: People and businesses are more connected than ever before (at least virtually). The Internet and social media have enabled crowdsourcing, a means for collective mobilization behind common goals. Crowdsourcing helps leaders seek innovative ideas from a global group of individuals with varying skills and CPOs are beginning to understand how opening the RFx process to wider audiences will revolutionize the field. Procurement technology acceleration: Nearly one in four CPOs report that digital transformation is a strategic initiative this year. Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics will impact human efforts for most administrative tasks. These seismic shifts in the procurement technology stack will significantly affect how teams conduct business. Cognitive computing: By 2030, thanks to cognitive computing (systems that mimic how the human brain processes information), strategic sourcing will take a fraction of the time. Almost every aspect of sourcing will utilize some form of machine learning or robotic processing automation. Hyper cybersecurity: Cyberattacks frequently originate from outside the company s firewall. Many breaches are due to inadequate protections when vendors and third parties access the network. That places the onus for (at least part of) data security efforts squarely on the Chief Procurement Office. By 2030, procurement professionals will need to be data security experts. Virtual organizational design: Automation and the emergence of the gig economy will shift the industry to a highly flexible, more decentralized model. By the decade s end, the procurement organization may be unrecognizable. ProcureAbility will explore these exciting new trends and more in upcoming issues. We hope you will gain valuable insights into what your professional future might hold and how you can prepare for it today.

Ideating New Procurement Practices During the formation of the Bold Procurement Predictions for 2030 Insights Series , ProcureAbility was very much focused on procurement teams maturity levels for accepting new practices and emerging trends. It quickly became clear that procurement organizations are all over the map in terms of the new processes and technologies adopted. Some are still mired in their core practices, while a small group of innovators are ideating new ways to leverage supply chain technology. The focus of ProcureAbility s effort was at the very top of the pyramid below: ideation. In this latest Insights, ProcureAbility explores Advanced Crowdsourcing, the first of five emerging trends that procurement organizations can expect to shift from the top of that pyramid to the bottom concepts that may seem far-fetched today, but will become standard accepted practice by 2030. We are living in a new era of innovation. Rapid advancements in people, process, and technology are transforming how the Procurement function delivers value, leaving leaders with a decision to adapt or be left behind. Advanced crowdsourcing People and organizations are more connected than ever before (at least virtually). The Internet and social media have drawn organizations much closer to stakeholders, paving the way for new methods of collaboration. This new paradigm has enabled crowdsourcing , a means for large groups of people to collectively mobilize behind common goals. With crowdsourcing, organizations can collect work, funds, information, or opinions from a huge number of contributors via the Internet, social channels, and mobile apps. The benefits of crowdsourcing For organizations, crowdsourcing offers a range of benefits, beginning with access to innovative ideas and solutions. The fact that crowdsourcing aligns communities to a common purpose means deeper engagement and, in turn, greater brand loyalty. By breaking complex, multi-faceted projects into smaller jobs, crowdsourcing delivers an efficient means to solve time-consuming problems. Crowdsourcing can look inward (e.g., gauging internal performance) or outward (e.g., tracking market trends). It allows people to share knowledge and resources with peers. If one million individuals were to contribute towards answering a problem via crowdsourcing, there would be a 97.7 likelihood that the crowd would arrive at the correct answer. 1 Crowdsourcing in procurement In procurement, crowdsourcing can be employed to receive bids or proposals from a rapidly evolving body of web-savvy suppliers. Chief Procurement Officers (CPOs) are beginning to understand the speed and cost savings to be realized by opening the RFx process to wider audiences. At this early stage, leveraging the power of crowdsourcing takes some effort from procurement teams. With so many contributors, teams are learning how to curate and review all the information coming into the department. Finding the right crowd to source can be difficult, requiring procurement professionals to vet contributors to ensure credibility. More so, crowdsourcing is highly visible. When a procurement department surfaces an online RFx, it can tip off competitors to new products or projects. Yet, despite these barriers, CPOs are seeing early successes with creating more value through aggregated action. The future of crowdsourcing ProcureAbility expects that a professional social network for procurement will emerge, becoming the predominant means of conducting the RFx process. This access to different skills and expertise is where the power resides when applying crowdsourcing to procurement. Buyers can hear from many prospective suppliers. A wider range of bidders produces better and faster market intelligence from suppliers and other buyers. The enhanced visibility of crowdsourcing increases awareness and contributions of smaller vendors who might otherwise be excluded from the process. Crowdsourcing pays equity dividends, opening avenues to buy from minority-owned and veteran-owned organizations. The bidding process is easier, as crowdsourcing platforms feature modern interfaces that require little training. While the ease-of-use increases participation, procurement teams can pre-vet vendors through a common, shared system and easily involve key stakeholders (e.g., finance, sales, and engineering). Crowdsourcing lowers supplier friction, reduces the time needed for sourcing events, decreases transaction costs, and supports an organization model aligned for both suppliers and buyers. By 2030, we expect at least half of all procurement activity to occur within the crowdsource domain and participation of smaller companies will increase by 70 .2 Crowdsourcing s increased visibility will feed competitive pressures and is expected to drive prices down. The next phase of crowdsourcing Advanced crowdsourcing has become more feasible as technology has evolved, and the procurement industry continues to test and adopt best practices. Procurement professionals can prepare for the inevitable changes in the field by reviewing current sourcing practices; keeping up with developments in mainstream sourcing; and considering what adjustments can be implemented in their practice and make updates when they make sense. By carefully examining processes and making thoughtful changes now, leaders can be ready when procurement crowdsourcing truly hits its stride by the end of the decade.

In this Insights series, ProcureAbility explores five emerging trends that procurement organizations should anticipate will transition from the top of the pyramid to the bottom by 2030, including advanced crowdsourcing, procurement technology acceleration, cognitive computing, hyper cybersecurity, and virtual organizational design. ProcureAbility is pleased to publish its Bold Procurement Predictions for 2030 Insights series to help Chief Procurement Officers make sense of it all, highlighting the new practices likely to become common by decade s end including advanced crowdsourcing, procurement technology acceleration, cognitive computing, hyper cybersecurity, and virtual organization design. In this edition of the Bold Procurement Predictions for 2030 Insights series, the product of extensive research and input from a think tank of experts in the supply chain field with a look at the rapid technology acceleration- is expected in the procurement practice by decade s end. Chief Procurement Officers are already re-evaluating processes, with nearly one in four reporting that digital transformation is a strategic initiative in 2022.1 The majority of mid- to large-size organizations report using e-procurement and e-sourcing software, and we predict use will grow exponentially in the coming years. Artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML), and predictive analytics will impact human efforts for most administrative tasks. These seismic shifts in procurement technology stack will have a significant impact on how teams conduct business. Here are a few of the emerging technologies we expect to gain mainstream acceptance by 2030: Interactive RFx and Purchasing Extended reality (xR) is a term used to describe a group of immersive technologies including virtual reality (a full environmental simulation) and augmented reality (in which virtual elements are overlaid onto the user s viewpoint). The extended-reality market will triple in value by 2028, according to one estimate.2 Extended Reality Is quickly becoming a useful tool in the Education, Entertainment, Gaming, Industrial Training, Automotive, Construction, and Healthcare industries. Virtual reality is expected to allow bidders the ability to present their proposals and associated materials live during auctions. Virtual delivery will take the place of site inspections, presentations, and even written bids. 3D Prototype Printing We anticipate that 3D printing will become an industrial staple in the next decade. Proposal submissions will be three-dimensional and fully rendered, rather than being printed on a physical or digital page. Furthermore, these prototypes will have to go through an accelerated review and approval cycle so buyers can provide feedback with quicker turnarounds between prototyping and implementation. Wearables and Intelligent Assistants Some consumer technologies will cross over into the professional realm, and the impact will undeniably be felt in procurement circles. Consider the ease with which you order goods from your smart speaker Hey, Assistant, order me paper towels! and the delivery arrives on your doorstep a few hours later. Apply that same convenience as developers create intelligent assistant apps for corporate procurement needs. Soon, a remote employee will say, Hey, Assistant, order me a new keyboard for work! . The new hardware from the corporate catalog will arrive, with corporate billing handled on the backend. We predict that wearable devices such as smart watches and smart jewelry, too, have more features available to procurement. Most purchasing processes and status updates will be handled, on demand, with a few words or taps to your wrist. Machine-Learning Contracting Process We expect that ML has the potential to replace the often-cumbersome process of cleansing and exchanging vast pools of data, virtually eliminating human error. The power of ML resides in the speed that it can access that information, analyze trends, and forecast future states. By 2030, standard terms and conditions will be controlled and updated by ML is based on algorithms learned from best practices and prior contract negotiations. Automated Negotiation Systems We believe that, by decade s end, negotiation will be automated using real-time data to predict the best tactics. Predictive analytics, fed by data collected from previous decisions, will be leveraged to take human emotion (and error) out of negotiation. Advanced automated negotiation systems will analyze negotiation inputs, incorporate real-time data, pull from past experiences, and then recommend strategies for any given scenario. What Now? IT executives must quickly begin investing in the technologies and systems that will educate their staff for the new standards sure to be widespread within ten years. Test and evaluate the innovative technologies so procurement experts may become familiar with them and how they will fit into an organization. Create an internal culture that encourages testing and adopting innovation. Today s technology implementation that is well-thought out, deliberate, and sensible can lead to a streamlined procurement process by 2030.

Some are still mired in their core practices, while a small group of innovators are ideating new ways to leverage supply chain technology.

In this Insights series, ProcureAbility explores five emerging trends that procurement organizations should anticipate will transition from the top of the pyramid to the bottom by 2030, including advanced crowdsourcing, procurement technology acceleration, cognitive computing, hyper cybersecurity, and virtual organizational design. This is the next release in ProcureAbility s Bold Procurement Predictions for 2030 Insights series. The study is the product of extensive research and input from a think tank of experts in the supply chain field. In this third chapter, ProcureAbility looks at the future of cognitive computing. Cognitive computing is a catchall term for a group of systems comprising of artificial intelligence (AI), expert systems, machine learning, robotic processing automation (RPA), and neural networks. The goal is to develop programs that mimic the way a human brain absorbs and processes information. In practice, a cognitive computing system is: Adaptive Learns and evolves Interactive Communicates across systems Iterative Solves ambiguous problems Stateful Invokes suitable information for the application at the time Contextual Identifies and extracts contextual elements The market for this technology is expected to grow to 77.5 billion by 20251. In fact, applications based on cognitive computing will expand across consumer, business, healthcare, industrial, and education markets. The procurement field will be no exception. Our Prediction By 2030, due to cognitive computing, strategic sourcing will take no longer than two weeks. Nearly every aspect of sourcing will utilize machine learning or RPA from setting up an event through contract execution. Intake AI will anticipate requests before they are submitted based on user patterns, stock levels, historic spend, contract PO expiration, and other predictive analytics, to make proactive and anticipatory procurement decisions. RFx Administration Strategic sourcing processes will be augmented with much of RFx administration handled by AI driven systems. Integrated and connected data sets will allow intelligent systems to participate in the source selection process: creating bid groups based on capability requirements, partnership potential, supplier capacity, commercial alignment to business needs, and past performance. Previously administrative activities will also be automated as the systems compile and distribute the RFx, manage vendor responses, conduct analysis, and deliver best value recommendations. All of this will serve to enable efficient and data-led decision making. A longer-term consideration is having machine learning AI field technical questions during the RFx. Tactical Procurement Tactical purchasing teams will turn to automated procurement mechanisms as they look to do more with less. Aided by AI-driven RFx support, tactical execution of discrete orders will be automated including the bidding, creation, and routing of POs. Runners and repeaters will be controlled by contracts with MRP systems autonomously executing orders and schedules against them. There will be a reliance on AI to manage order replenishment, quoting, lead time updates, and open order reporting. Tactical procurement roles will shift to focus on system maintenance, exception messages, relationship management, and procurement strategy. RFx Strategy and Negotiations Cognitive systems will complement the human effort in sourcing strategy and negotiations analyzing past results to recommend options. Streamlined Sourcing With cognitive systems at work in the practice, procurement teams can see some significant workflow improvements. Artificial intelligence will help procurement teams get ahead of a client s business needs. Machine learning will sort through vast databases and cross-reference what was sourced in the past, how frequently, at what volume, and what end use behavior looked like. Intelligent systems can use this data to automatically trigger future intake inquiries at the optimal times. Cognitive computing will yield efficiency gains. We expect most administrative tasks to be automated (intake, strategy recommendations, RFP development and administration, evaluation and scoring, and scenario analysis). Teams will need to pivot to more strategic skill sets, such as relationship development. Impressively, cognitive computing will even help generate new sourcing strategies. By 2030, expect artificial intelligence to become a dispassionate aid to human efforts when executing negotiations and developing future strategy blueprints. What Now? We understand that cognitive computing will affect workflows and long-accepted process. ProcureAbility recommends that organizations conduct an assessment of their sourcing processes, develop plans to utilize next-gen technology systems, and then begin exploring areas to apply AI and machine learning technologies.

It quickly became clear that procurement organizations are all over the map in terms of the new processes and technologies adopted. Some are still mired in their core practices, while a small group of innovators are ideating new ways to leverage supply chain technology.

In this Insights series, ProcureAbility explores five emerging trends that procurement organizations should anticipate will transition from the top of the pyramid to the bottom by 2030, including advanced crowdsourcing, procurement technology acceleration, cognitive computing, hyper cybersecurity, and virtual organizational design. In this edition of the Bold Procurement Predictions for 2030 Insights series, ProcureAbility examines a problem that has been plaguing companies for years and will only get more challenging. Digital security and the threat of data breaches are not the sole prevue of information technology professionals. Cyber-attacks frequently originate from outside the company s firewall. Many breaches are due to inadequate protections when allowing vendors and third parties access to portions of the network. 44 Of executives report that the increased use of suppliers and partners expose the company to more security threats.1 That places the onus for (at least part of) data security efforts squarely on the Chief Procurement Officer. The State of Data Security Security experts define a cyberattack as an attempt to gain access to a computer network. The intent is almost always malicious. Cybercriminals can pursue any number of objectives: information theft, sabotage, espionage, and financial gain. Hackers are growing more sophisticated at exploiting vulnerabilities and can gain access to networks through phishing emails, malicious website access, file downloads (via the web and email), second-stage downloads, and command-and-control communications. With businesses reporting more than 800 cyberattacks in the first half of 2022 alone, and the average long-term cost of a data breach exceeding 8.6 million, it s not a problem that leaders can ignore.4 Sourcing for Security The vast majority 82 percent of technology leaders believe their supply chains are vulnerable to hackers. Procurement can expect to take on new responsibilities for the company s data security as cybersecurity monitoring gains prominence. Evaluation (and re-evaluation) of vendors cybersecurity posture will become part of the sourcing process. New roles will emerge; some businesses may appoint cybersecurity category leads with duties spanning information technology and procurement. Tighter Supplier Pools To mitigate security risks, ProcureAbility predicts that firms will consolidate supplier pools. By 2030, many businesses will choose to work with fewer suppliers, bundling products or services. The remaining vendors will be expected to meet rigid requirements for data security. To ensure ongoing compliance, closer partnerships will evolve between sourcing, legal, and cybersecurity teams to continuously evaluate existing contracts and templates and refresh cybersecurity terms as warranted. More Spend for Security Across businesses of all types, investment in cybersecurity mitigation will surge as attacks become more frequent and sophisticated. ProcureAbility predicts that cybersecurity spend will increase by 30 percent by 2030. Finding optimal products, talent, and services in this category will be a top priority. We expect that cybersecurity monitoring and prevention services will become a top ten spend category and a crucial partnership for businesses. This will be true for large enterprises and small organizations alike. While strong cybersecurity measures have traditionally been reserved for large businesses, criminals have naturally gravitated toward smaller, less security-savvy organizations that they consider easier targets. What Now? Cybersecurity is an ongoing arms race between technically sophisticated criminals and the security professionals charged to protect network infrastructure. Supply chain functions, due to their close dealings with vendors and suppliers (who may not have rigorous data security standards) will find they will need to adopt new practices to protect the company. Procurement practices should expect to develop cybersecurity-related category expertise. ProcureAbility recommends that organizations conduct detailed cybersecurity risk assessments for all vendors (either internally or through a third party), evaluate vendors security compliance, and develop plans to implement stringent security measures. After all, the weakest link in your data security chain could be your most trusted supplier.

In this Insights series, ProcureAbility explores five emerging trends that procurement organizations should anticipate will transition from the top of the pyramid to the bottom by 2030, including advanced crowdsourcing, procurement technology acceleration, cognitive computing, hyper cybersecurity, and virtual organizational design. Before we examine our final bold prediction in this series, let us review where we have been. These are ProcureAbility s Bold Procurement Predictions for 2030 to date: Advanced crowdsourcing By 2030, we expect at least half of all procurement activity will occur within the crowdsource domain and participation of smaller companies will increase by 70 percent. Crowdsourcing s increased visibility will feed competitive pressures, driving prices down. Procurement technology acceleration Virtual delivery will replace site visits, presentations, and written proposals. 3D-printed prototypes will be standard operating procedure. We predict that virtual assistants will be available to order items from the corporate catalog with the same convenience we see from smart speakers today. By 2030, standard terms and conditions will be controlled and updated by machine learning, and AI will recommend negotiation tactics. Cognitive computing By 2030, thanks to cognitive computing, strategic sourcing will take no longer than two weeks. Nearly every aspect of sourcing will utilize some form of machine learning or robotic processing automation. Hyper cybersecurity ProcureAbility predicts that cybersecurity spend will increase by 30 percent and that monitoring and prevention services will become a top category. Firms will work with fewer suppliers who will need to meet rigid data security requirements. These innovations underpin ProcureAbility s final Bold Procurement Prediction for 2030: By the end of this decade, we believe there will be a widespread shift towards center-led procurement. While leading procurement organizations have been moving toward this model for some time, we predict that by 2030 the center-led procurement model will have evolved to an entirely new level. Procurement organizations will consist of a core business unit, while 90 percent of operational sourcing roles will be automated or outsourced to contractors. Automation and Center-Led Procurement Artificial intelligence and advanced automation will be key drivers in the march toward center-led procurement. Research suggests that by the mid-decade, a substantial portion, one third, of all highly skilled work is set to be impacted by intelligent machines or non-specialist personnel supported by cognitive computing. ProcureAbility predicts that automation will serve as a great complement to human workforces. Far from the machines will take our jobs trope, we expect that automation, as a procurement tool, will improve cost savings, quality, and compliance: Lead times, downtime, and service interruptions will plummet. The Gig Economy and Center-Led Procurement By 2030, core procurement organization will be expected to centralize processes, manage data analytics, and drive business strategy. To facilitate this pivot, firms will contract category experts and consultants to handle specialized tasks. This trend has been in play for years with contingent, temporary, and contract labor poised to become the majority of the workforce by 2027. With benefits accounting for 32 of employee costs, organizations using contractors can realize serious savings while enjoying a greater degree of scalability, flexing up or down as the business demands. What Now? ProcureAbility recommends that procurement firms assess their organizations current designs and determine what changes will be required to build more responsive, adaptable sourcing teams. Develop a plan to optimize automation and restructure staff, seeding contracted generalists in the department as necessary. By the end of the decade, procurement organizations will be smaller and more agile, with a heavy focus on relationship building and business strategy. 2030 is Closer than You Think This study uncovered that we are experiencing something of a perfect storm in terms of business upheaval. Technology, economic changes, and societal shifts are all driving new methods for running a successful supply chain operation. While no one has a crystal ball, we believe these predictions reflect a reasonable expectation for where procurement is headed. Change is never easy, but by carefully examining your current processes and taking steps to prepare your organization for what s coming, you will be well-positioned to be the leading example of the modern procurement operation in 2030.

    "text": "Procurement Organizations of the Future: A Human-centered Approach to Managing Relationships with Suppliers Procurement organizations manage an often-complex web of relationships with suppliers and vendors, connecting with these external partners to resolve cost disputes, create or renew agreements, discuss, resolve operational issues, and ensure the business continues to procure the goods or services that they need to do their job at a fair price. An inclusive procurement strategy proactively manages these supplier relationships to create long-term, strategic partnerships that can withstand the storm of market uncertainty and changing needs. By treating suppliers as valued partners, procurement can shift from an old outdated us-vs-them mentality and create immeasurable benefits on both sides of the aisle. WHAT VALUE DO SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS PROVIDE? Supplier relationships refer to the type of partnership that your organization has with external vendors of goods and services. This includes suppliers that have established contract agreements as well as suppliers that do not have an agreement but that the business cuts purchase orders to on a regular basis. Historically, procurement organizations have viewed suppliers as rivals, or at best, cautious allies. This type of mindset has led to a culture of aggressive cost negotiations and an impetus to pit suppliers against each other to achieve price concessions at any cost. While this can lead to short-term gains, this adversarial mentality makes it more difficult to achieve lasting savings and creates a significant amount of unnecessary work for both procurement and for the supplier team. By pursuing a conscious and ethical supplier relationship management program, you can begin to rebuild, repair, and improve existing supplier relationships and create a culture shift throughout the organization. This change creates savings in any market, provides service and quality benefits, reduces the day-to-day tactical work from procurement, and increases the respect from the people with whom you work on a day-to-day basis. All the tangible benefits aside, it s also the right thing to do and will be noticed and appreciated by your suppliers. THE DOWNSIDE OF SHORT-TERM THINKING Let s explore a hypothetical example of an organization that does not value their supplier relationships. Hamburgers R Us is a mature, established food company that has expanded rapidly throughout the US and their procurement organization has pushed for hard savings above all else. 3 year-over-year Key vendors have been asked to decrease their cost by 3 year-over-year or risk having their volume reduced. Supplier performance meetings have generally been reactive, contentious, inefficient, and focused on grievances from the business. Requests for proposals and quick bids For requests for proposals (RFPs) and quick bids, vendors have little to no trust that the best and last bid will be accepted by the business, so they have learned to pad their best and latest bid by 5-10 as part of the process. That way when Hamburgers R Us asks for more concessions, they have some built-in flexibility to provide further reductions. Vendor payment terms For vendor payment terms, Hamburgers R Us has aggressively pushed to move vendors to favorable discount payment terms, citing key performance metrics (KPIs) and strategic goals directed from the Chief Procurement Officer (CPO). Vendors have been very hesitant to agree to these payment terms however, because they do not trust that they will be paid on schedule. These vendors are already managing late payments from Hamburgers R Us and are concerned that these new discount terms will worsen their existing cash flow issues. Uncomfortable suggesting changes Vendors do not feel comfortable suggesting process changes, product substitutions, or alternative savings strategies. For one, they do not have that one person with whom they have built a trusted working relationship. They also worry that Hamburgers R Us might accept the process change and then use it as a rationale to push for even more price concessions. Everyone dreads cost season Finally, the actual representatives from the supplier s report being demoralized and treated harshly. They report a culture of passing the buck and feel no loyalty to their main contacts at Hamburger R Us. Cost season is a mountain of work that everyone dreads, and price increases often resort in stalemates with suppliers threatening to stop shipment of the product until Hamburger R Us comes to an agreement that works for all parties. This is just an example, but it is very common for procurement organizations to employ some or all these negative business strategies illustrated in this example ingrained into their organizational mindset. Recognizing these lingering negative factors is the first step to affecting real change. STRENGTHENING SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS Upon recognizing a need to improve your relationships with suppliers, there are several key next steps to influencing and implementing change: Recognize and name the problem Without a recognition that challenges exist, there will be inertia to any amount of change. Holding steadfastly to the status quo is very appealing, however by highlighting the benefits that we have discussed and having a concise, clear message allows you to persuade people and make them feel invested in the journey. Identify key suppliers Identifying your most strategic suppliers will be the first priority for improved relationships. These could be suppliers that provide business-critical goods and services, or it could be suppliers that provide the largest amount of spend. Include quick-win suppliers as well these are suppliers with whom you already have positive relationships who can provide initial successes to demonstrate to your peers and the broader organization this transformation will work. Create a cadence of communication Reactive communication breeds mistrust, inefficiency, and uncertainty. Conversely, proactive communication breeds creativity, accountability, and collaboration. Standing monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly meetings with the supplier representative to review and assess identified KPIs, address outstanding issues, and brainstorm on win-win process changes and product substitutions build trust and productivity. Be a good customer Small changes will amplify and create significant positive relationship windfalls for your organization. Pay suppliers on time and be responsive to their complaints and questions. Be honest and transparent throughout the RFX Bid process. For suppliers that are removed from a bid process, provide constructive feedback so they can improve for the next iteration of the bid. Tie prices to publicly available indices whenever possible to free up time on both ends and focus on the big picture. Above all else, be kind to the representatives that interact with your organization. Treat them like human beings and when there are issues or problems that come up, address them proactively and respectively. The representatives will appreciate the open dialogue and will be much more likely to collaboratively partner with you to solve issues when they feel valued and respected. Provide awards and recognition Some companies will create a supplier recognition program that rewards suppliers who meet or exceed their KPIs. Other companies will outline stretch KPI metrics in their contracts and provide cost rebates to incentivize suppliers. Whatever the approach, the goal is to reward suppliers who are consistently meeting and exceeding expectations over the long-term and to cultivate productive business relationships. By incorporating the above strategies, you can contribute to an inclusive procurement strategy and help create a procurement organization of the future. https: procureability.com a-human-centered-approach-to-managing-relationships-with-suppliers",

    "text": "Procurement Organizations of the Future: A Human-centered Approach to Managing Internal Procurement Relationships Procurement organizations do not operate in siloes. We as procurement professionals work within the structure of much larger organizations that bring in other internal departments and stakeholders daily. An inclusive procurement strategy strengthens these internal relationships to create efficient, collaborative, and ethical links that make it both easier and more rewarding for all teams involved. By investing the effort to build these connections early and often, procurement organizations of the future will experience immeasurable benefits. Who are key internal relationships? Internal relationships involve any other member of your organization who resides outside the procurement function but must interact with your procurement team, so you are able to complete normal responsibilities and initiatives. These stakeholders include: Corporate LoB requestors Engineering Finance C-Suite leadership Third-party governance Risk Legal Operations As an example, a Line of Business (LoB) partner from manufacturing reaches out to ask procurement for assistance in sourcing a widget, indicating this as a time-sensitive ask that needs to be completed quickly to meet production quotas. You would first want to meet with operations and engineering to ensure that you understand the design specs before involving potential suppliers. If the dollar amount is above a predetermined threshold, you may be required to secure approval from Corporate or C-Suite. It is important to connect with finance as well to create a spend baseline that will help you claim savings down the road. This all happens before sending out a single RFX document to suppliers. Once you pick a supplier in collaboration with the business stakeholder, you will work with legal and third-party governance to manage and address all potential risks. This is especially important if you are creating a long-term MSA or onboarding a new supplier. You can see how even in this very simple example, you needed to connect with several internal stakeholders. Why do internal relationships matter? At their best, these relationships can be fruitful, mutually respectful partnerships that view both sides as value adds and work to make advancing mutual goals easier and more efficient. At their worst, these relationships can descend into lack of communication, infighting, mistrust, and conflict. We have all heard disgruntled voices refer to procurement as roadblocks or paper pushers who are more focused on cost savings than on making sure the business has what it needs. This causes real issues when the stakes are high, and timelines are tight. Without a strong, two-way communication channel with legal, that could cause complex contract negotiations to be delayed or even derailed at the slightest hiccup. If you don t have a strong relationship with operations, that can result in employees resorting to P-Cards or other maverick spend to bypass the established procurement processes. What causes friction with internal partners? Status Quo Disruption Business units and other departments may be used to the status quo. They might not understand the benefits of competitive bidding and spend authority limits. In many cases they might say: I ve never had to justify purchase awards before, why are you making me jump through these hoops? Unfamiliar Tools and Processes The last thing we as procurement professionals should want to do is toss our partners in the deep end of the pool. Yet often that is what happens. LoBs are told to use a new eCatalog without adequate training or given a new Procurement SharePoint link without an explanation as to why it might be useful for them. Insufficient Communication Channels If people don t know who to reach out to for help, they can get frustrated. Lack of Respect Everyone is so busy that it can be easy to forget to take a moment and appreciate the people with whom you work. Compound this problem over months or years and suddenly you have two functions that do not have respect for each other. How can I improve my relationships? Do Not Throw Things Over the Fence Use the Gate Throwing things over the fence means passing the buck to another department without taking the time to provide context or support during the hand-off. Taking the extra ten minutes to clarify asks or participate on a call to bring the others up to speed can go a long way. Understand Your Role and Theirs Everyone has their role to play and taking a minute to truly understand where the other function is coming from can make all the difference. Come from that place of empathy and make sure to verbalize your understanding and how you plan to incorporate their concerns into the strategy moving forward. Share Visibility Into the Road Ahead Proper pipeline planning can be the difference between an efficient, well-managed department and an all-hands-on-deck fire. Whenever possible, share details of upcoming RFPs, contract renewals, or supplier onboardings with the relevant partners so they can free up workload and be prepared. Work Collaboratively and Strategically Working together can make the process easier and avoid miscommunication. Have business leads participate in building RFX templates and participate in negotiation. If you have been working on a particularly difficult contract negotiation with a lot of language redlines, consider looping in legal to help talk directly to the supplier. Communicate Early and Often The more lead time you can give other functions before asking them to review or complete work, the less impact you will have on their workload burden and the more appreciative and willing to help they will be. This early communication can be across any number of channels including a phone call, email, IM, or even stopping by their desk. Note Individual Preferences and Remember Them Different stakeholders have varying work and communication styles. Some people like to use a quick 15-minute working session while others prefer to collaborate over email. Other stakeholders like shorter, more frequent communication, while others might prefer a weekly or monthly more comprehensive report. Perhaps a key internal stakeholder is a morning person: Make a note of any individual preferences and respect them whenever possible. It s a very simple change that can have you seen as a great team player and overall coworker. Define What Success Looks Like Success should be defined before any work happens. If we are looking at a sourcing initiative, reach out to finance and create a savings baseline. Data is key and by creating that baseline before anything else, it becomes that much easier to claim savings from your hard work. Look at and Understand the Why It can be frustrating to be told that you must connect with legal for example and complete this or that task. At the end of the day though, everyone is on the same team. Ask why this task needs to be completed and you might be surprised to hear the answer. Often many of the tasks we consider to be burdensome or useless are there for a very thoughtful reason. Look Back and Reflect Always make sure to look back after the fact and reflect on how you interacted with your stakeholders. Were you able to improve the relationship and be a team player? If not, why not, and how can you fix that moving forward. By following these best practices, you can help build a procurement organization of the future that cares for not just its own people but the colleagues that interact with procurement every day. Procurement organizations of the future look to build respect and allies across the whole company, recognizing that it s not just good for procurement s needs, but also the right thing to do for everyone. https: procureability.com human-approach-procurement-relationships",

    "text": "Procurement Organizations of the Future: A Human-centered Approach to Supplier Diversity Procurement firms of the future look to weave DEI into all facets of their organization s ecosystem, recognizing that doing the right thing is also the right thing for business. Diversity doesn t live solely within the walls of your company. Supplier diversity programs identify potential suppliers that can inject a high level of diverse goods and services into the supply chain, thereby increasing vendor competition, improving the quality of goods and services, creating greater resiliency and agility, and potentially cutting costs. An inclusive procurement strategy widens the pool of potential suppliers and promotes competition in the supply base, which can improve product quality and drive down costs. By providing more sourcing options, inclusiveness can make supply chains more resilient and agile an increasingly important advantage in these uncertain times. Procurement departments of every stripe have begun to pay close attention to their supplier portfolio, looking at who they buy from and what they can do to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion with their spend. Defining a Diverse Supplier A diverse supplier is a business that is at least 51 owned and operated by an individual or group that is part of a traditionally underrepresented or underserved group. Typical diverse categories are varied but the most common categories are listed in the table below. Some of these categorizations are across traditional socio-economic categories, including women-owned or LGBTQ -owned certifications. Others are newer certification categories that focus on environmentally friendly practices or local- and small-business suppliers. Typical Diversity Categories Women-owned Minority-owned LGBTQ2 -owned Veteran-owned Disabled veteran-owned Disabled-owned Locally owned Small business HUBZone small business Green certified Diverse Supplier Certifications and Certifying Agencies The most important goal of a supplier diversity program is to increase the ease of access and visibility of diverse suppliers into the spend portfolio of your company. It can be challenging to glean whether suppliers are diverse and to compare metrics over time. Leveraging existing certifications and certifying agencies can help in this vetting process. Organizations such as the National Minority Supplier Diversity Council have a whole host of resources for your supplier diversity program including MBE-Certification services for vendors and vendor lists by region and type. They also host events to bring vendors and clients together, as well as other useful learning resources. It is advantageous to look at both national and local organizations: National organizations often bring more resources and established vendor lists to bear while local organizations may be more familiar with local communities and state laws governing supplier diversity incentives. Common Certifying Agencies National Minority Supplier Diversity Council Women s Business Enterprise National Council National Women s Business Council Small Business Administration U.S. National Gay Lesbian Chamber of Commerce Disabled Veterans Business Alliance National Veteran Business Development Council National Hispanic Chamber of Commerce State and Local Actions States and local governments have a strong interest in encouraging a strong diverse business community. To that end, many states have enacted programs and regulations to foster strong diverse supplier programs and make it as easy as possible for you to achieve your portfolio goals. These programs generally fall under two categories: Regulations for Regulated Industries and Public Companies: States like California and Illinois have implemented regulations for public procurement programs and those belonging to regulated industries, such as utilities. In Illinois for example, utilities must submit an annual report on all procurement goals and actual spending for female-owned, minority-owned, veteran-owned, and small business enterprises in the previous calendar year and the utilities plan for implementing and realizing their goals for the following year. Supplier Diversity Departments and Programs: Almost every state has a program dedicated to providing resources for both diverse suppliers and those looking to do business with diverse suppliers. These programs help suppliers navigate certification and host certified supplier lists. These programs can also hold events and host valuable informational resources. Elements of a Comprehensive Supplier Diversity Action Plan A strong supplier diversity action plan is a comprehensive guiding document meant to increase representation and remove existing barriers for Minority Women-owned Business Enterprises (MWBE)-certified suppliers. Generally, they are made up of the following features: KPI s Diversity Metrics: Numbers don t lie. If you want to tackle the real systemic issues and demonstrate real progress to your employees and to the world, then picking a few key metrics makes all the difference. The table below shows some common metrics including Diverse Spend, New Diverse Suppliers Engaged, and Number of Supplier Diversity Trainings Events held. Often metrics like percent-of-spend are broken out via product or category cross-sections. Current State: Where are you now? Having a clear understanding of the starting point is crucial in this step. It may be challenging to analyze the current metrics and realize that they are not where you want them to be, but by being honest you can position yourself for success. Future-State Goals: Where do you want to be in 3 years? In 5 years? These future-state goals should track to the KPIs that you outlined previously in your action plan. They should be challenging yet attainable, and you should have actions or key changes laid out to achieve these goals. They won t happen on a luck and a prayer alone! Responsibility for Updating: A Supplier Diversity Action plan should be a living, breathing document. Otherwise, it could grow stale and outdated. It s important to have a person or department that is directly responsible for updating and tracking to the metrics outlined in the KPI s and goals. Metric Definition Diverse Spend Total spend with diverse suppliers, measured in raw dollars and as a percentage of external spend New Diverse Spend Total dollars of new, incremental spend with diverse suppliers each year Supplier Count Total number of engaged diverse suppliers, or narrowed to count of diverse suppliers with spend New Diverse Suppliers Engaged Total count of new diverse suppliers engaged each year Event Participation Percentage of sourcing events that include diverse suppliers in the competitive mix Trainings Completed Count of training and engagement events conducted for diverse suppliers Should Your Firm Publish Your Plan? Many companies keep their supplier diversity plan and goals private in an effort to avoid any negative external reaction to their metrics or to prevent a scenario where expectations are created but which cannot be met. This is short-sighted and many companies are realizing that publishing diversity targets (or even publishing annual diversity reports) can play a significant part in improving both reputation and candidate attraction. The public (and investors) increasingly expect companies to practice good social governance and a critical part of that is allowing entry for historically under-represented communities into the global supply chain. New employees have come to demand social change; like attracts like, and a company that embeds supplier diversity into its business objectives can attract and retain top-level talent. A diverse supplier program can also help tap into a growing and changing customer base. Many firms are putting both financial and human capital resources towards achieving their greater supplier diversity goals: Company Articulated Targets Coca-Cola 1B in diverse supplier spend by 2025 PWC 40 of external spend with diverse suppliers by 2026 Intel 2B in diverse spend by 2030; 800MM by 2023 McDonalds 3.5B (25 ) of external spend with diverse suppliers Target 2B by 2025 F100 Average 10 of external spend with diverse suppliers; average target is 20 by 2025 Procurement firms of the future look to weave DEI into all facets of their organization s ecosystem, recognizing that doing the right thing is also the right thing for business.

    "text": "PROCUREMENT ORGANIZATIONS OF THE FUTURE: A Human-centered Approach to ESG Goals An inclusive procurement strategy leverages marketplace opportunities to build strong, forward-thinking, dynamic teams that are diverse, inclusive, and put people on par with profits. By paying attention to ESG responsibilities, equity can make procurement organizations more adaptable and forward-looking an important advantage in shifting supply chain environments. ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE CRITERIA AND GOALS Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues have been front-and-center across corporate America over the last few years. Companies of all stripes have pushed increasingly ambitious goals and ESG1 visions in order to satisfy their consumers, get ahead of regulations, or placate banks and investors. Those efforts have often paid off, with top ESG performers enjoying faster growth and higher valuations than other players in their sector. 2 ESG Environmental Climate Change Energy and Fuel Environmental Compliance Greenhouse Gas Emissions Pollution Control Resource Scarcity Waste and Recycling Water Use Social Diversity and Equality Employee Relations Environmental Justice Health and Safety Human Rights Non-Discrimination Security Training and Education Governance Board Diversity Bribery and Corruption Ethics Executive Compensation Political Lobbying Procurement Practices Resilience Risk Management The CPO, and by extension the procurement organization, plays a key role in meeting those ESG roles. Procurement can heavily influence an organization s ESG footprint, through purchasing decisions, by influencing product design, and by encouraging equity and creating happy engaged teams within their own workforce. These criteria apply as much internally, as they do externally and by taking a leadership role, the CPO and the purchasing organization can create a ripple effect across every other department. HOW TO SELECT AND ACHIEVE ESG GOALS Assess Current State The first step is to create a baseline of where the organization is right now. It s important to conduct an honest assessment and accurately reflect current metrics and opportunities for development, critical activities in the process of becoming a procurement organization of the future. Align on Key Metrics Picking some key metrics ahead of time will allow you to use data to track progress and implement any course corrections needed. Key metrics should be personalized to your procurement organization. Some examples that can be used as starting off points include: diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) hiring and retention numbers; carbon footprint reduction across your supply chain; and establishment and adherence to a code of ethical conduct. Create Actionable Goals for Those Key Metrics The SMART principle is of paramount importance. Make sure the goals you pick are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. Be ambitious and make sure to create these goals as a team to ensure buy-in and accountability. Make a Plan What do the next 3-5 years look like to meet these ESG goals? When will a check-in be most effective to course correct (if necessary)? Shout it Out This is not a one-and-done project that can be wrapped up and revisited later. ESG goals need to become part of the DNA of your procurement organization. Make sure the CPO or the leader of your organization clearly states, This is important to me, and I want it to be important to each and every one of you. In that way you can ensure the push has legitimacy and the necessary impulse to keep moving forward. INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS Industry associations can be strong partners in achieving ESG goals and providing change management support. Some industry associations host conferences and events where procurement professionals can learn and grow. Others create connections between industry leaders to introduce suppliers, purchasing organizations, and strategic partners to create lasting partnerships that benefit all parties. Still others look to affect change at the individual level, providing scholarships for higher education or mentorship programs that can develop leaders of the future. Find the industries and activities that work with your organization and participate in these industry activities. Consider being a financial sponsor to these organizations as well; many of the educational sponsorships for underrepresented communities to study supply chain rely on the generosity of individuals and companies. In this way you can affect change far beyond just the walls of your organization. Company Articulated Targets Awesome (Achieving women s excellence in supply chain operations, management, and Education) Seeks to bring together senior women leaders in supply chain for connecting, learning, collaboration, recognition, and inspiration; Provides events for leaders to engage in learning activities and provides scholarships for underrepresented women to major in supply chain NMSDC Creates connections between minority business enterprises (MBEs) and corporations, MBEs and the public sector, and MBEs and other MBEs, to help them benefit from each other, stoking entrepreneurship and growing wealth for these systemically excluded communities.

    "text": "Procurement Organizations of the Future: Adapt or Fall Behind: How to Reskill and Upskill Your Procurement Team Amid Rapid Change Procurement is rapidly changing with the introduction of innovative technologies and procurement trends that will revolutionize the way organizations operate. In the coming decade, procurement teams will need to reorient their skillsets to adapt to this ever-changing landscape. Recently, ProcureAbility published our Insights series Five Bold Procurement Predictions for 2030 , in which we extrapolate on the future of procurement trends including advanced crowdsourcing, procurement technology acceleration, cognitive computing, hyper cybersecurity, and virtual organization design. As these trends continue to take hold, the role of procurement will evolve, requiring a comprehensive reskilling and upskilling effort to keep up with these sophisticated procurement predictions. In this article, we explore what evolution may look like over the next several years. But first, we will make the case for adopting approaches that capture technology s promise in a way that puts humans at the center, as the key enablers of success. Maintaining a Human-Centered Approach The rapid advancement of technology is disrupting the way procurement teams operate. Although more tasks will be automated in the future, navigating a complex business environment will still require human intuition and judgement. To determine how teams should adapt, procurement can be broken down into two categories: strategic leadership functions informed by technology, and tactical or administrative roles that will be performed by modern technologies but managed by humans. While a retooling of hard skills is necessary to adapt to these innovative technologies, soft skills will also need a collective rethink as technology upends the external environment, as well as the internal one. Upskilling will be required both for strategic leaders in making use of the information these innovative technologies produce, and those who will need to manage technology that is taking over some of their former tasks. In this case, digital upskilling (learning new technologies to modernize businesses), is the most important. Skills such as relationship management, empathy, patience, conflict resolution, and creativity will also remain competencies critical to navigating the often-complex social network of organizations, both large and small. For instance, maintaining an emphasis on inclusive procurement strategies to proactively manage supplier relationships will create long-term, strategic partnerships that can withstand the storm of market uncertainty and changing needs. Internally, managing cross-functional and intra-team relationships is critical both for cohesiveness and for achieving the mutual objectives of groups within a company, aimed towards a common goal. Procurement and sourcing soft skills include: Supplier collaboration and management Stakeholder collaboration Focus on sustainable sourcing Improve collaboration and communication Identify and implement best practices Interpersonal skills Result-oriented Negotiation skills Standardize processes Implement methods to trim down suppliers costs Analytical and presentation skills Five Human-Centered Procurement Trends ProcureAbility recommends that procurement organizations concentrate their reskilling and upskilling efforts on five bold procurement trends that are likely to become prevalent within this decade. Their ability to harness these trends for competitive advantage, while also managing the associated risks, will assuredly depend on the humans at the controls, specifically their ability to improve technical expertise, solve problems, and engage in strategic thinking. A human-centered approach to procurement is more important than ever to create value for the organizations in which procurement serves. Advanced crowdsourcing People and organizations are now more connected than ever before, and this has enabled the growth of crowdsourcing for individual and social causes. In the future, procurement organizations will leverage this to receive bids or proposals from a rapidly evolving body of web-savvy suppliers. Procurement professionals can prepare for inevitable changes in the field by: Reviewing current sourcing practices Keeping up with developments in mainstream sourcing Considering what adjustments can be implemented in their practice Make updates when they make sense Procurement technology acceleration The majority of mid- to large-size organizations report using e-procurement and e-sourcing software, and we predict use will grow exponentially in the coming years. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and predictive analytics will impact human efforts for most administrative tasks. These seismic shifts in procurement technology stack will significantly impact how teams conduct business. IT executives must quickly begin investing in the technologies and systems that will educate their staff for the new standards anticipated to be widespread within ten years or less. They will need to test and evaluate the innovative technologies so procurement experts may become familiar with them and how they will fit into an organization, while creating an internal culture that encourages testing and adopting innovation. Cognitive computing With cognitive systems at work, procurement teams can see significant workflow improvements. More specifically, we can expect most administrative tasks to be automated (intake, strategy recommendations, RFP development and administration, evaluation and scoring, and scenario analysis). Procurement leaders will need to focus their training shift towards providing teams with the tools to build strategic skill sets, such as relationship Procurement organizations will also need to conduct assessments of their sourcing processes and develop comprehensive training plans that utilize next-gen technology systems and explore areas to apply AI and ML technologies. Hyper cybersecurity As more business activities become digitized and automated, companies will need to focus on cyber security to protect an increasingly target-rich environment from sophisticated hackers, through finding optimal talent, products, and services. ProcureAbility predicts that cyber security spend will increase by 30 percent in 2030. It is critical that procurement leaders train their teams to implement procurement practices with a focus on cybersecurity-related category expertise. Virtual organizational design By 2030, core procurement organizations will be expected to centralize processes, manage data analytics, and drive business strategy. Procurement firms will first need to assess their organizations current designs and determine what changes will be required to build more responsive, adaptable sourcing teams. To maximize optimization, they will need to develop a plan to restructure, reskill, and upskill their staff, seeding contracted generalists in the department, as necessary. Ultimately, procurement organizations will be smaller and more agile, with a heavy focus on relationship building and business strategy. The fast pace of technological progress is changing how procurement teams operate now and over the next several years. To take advantage of these advancements and remain innovative and competitive, companies must adjust and improve their skill sets. They should focus on developing technical proficiency, problem-solving abilities, and strategic thinking while upholding a human-centered approach as their North Star. By doing so, procurement teams can adapt to the evolving environment and generate greater value for their organizations. https: procureability.com adapt-or-fall-behind-how-to-reskill-and-upskill-your-procurement-team-amid-rapid-change",
